Synopsis
On a routine short flight, during final approach to land, the No 2 engine reduced to idle and 
would not respond to any control inputs.  The flight crew performed a missed approach 
and, following the relevant checklist procedure, elected to shut down the engine.  They 
then performed an uneventful single-engine approach and landed safely.  The engineering 
investigation determined that the cause of the engine problem was most likely an inadvertent 
activation of the overspeed protection valve in the fuel control system. The problem has 
occurred previously on other V2500 engines and is being addressed through safety actions 
by the engine and aircraft manufacturers.
History of the flight
The aircraft was scheduled to conduct a preservation flight1 on 28 May 2021, departing from 
and returning to Stansted Airport and lasting approximately 45 minutes.  The operating crew 
positioned from Vienna to Stansted as passengers on a commercial flight, arriving in the 
crew room at Stansted at 0630 hrs.  They waited for the morning engineering shift to come 
on duty at 0700 hrs and the aircraft was handed over to them shortly afterwards.  The crew 
conducted the standard walkaround and pre-departure checks with no abnormal findings.  
The aircraft departed from Stand 33L at 0803 hrs after a normal engine start and pushback 
and taxied to line up and hold on Runway 22.

Whilst holding on the runway, the crew were requested by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to 
consider a new Standard Instrument Departure (SID) route, but they declined this request 
to avoid the need to re-brief the departure whilst positioned on an active runway.  They 
were given clearance to take off and climb to FL080 following the CLN1E SID, which they 
completed without issue.  They were subsequently given radar vectors to line up for an ILS 
approach to land back on Runway 22.  
During the final approach, at 950 ft radio altitude and with autothrust engaged, an ‘eng 2 
fadec fault’ appeared on the Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM).  The crew 
elected to go around and manually flew the standard missed approach profile, before 
entering a hold to perform troubleshooting of the fault. During this period the No 2 engine 
remained at idle despite manual throttle increases and the reselection of autothrust. The 
crew also reported seeing apparently erroneous engine parameter readings relative to the 
selected throttle position. After entering the hold, the immediate ECAM checklist actions 
were performed.  The crew reported that the engine indications were not showing amber 
XX, but appeared to be frozen and were still not responding to any throttle inputs.  The 
ECAM checklist directed that in the case of abnormal engine parameters the engine should 
be shut down.  The crew consulted the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) for further 
guidance, before starting the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and shutting down the No 2 engine.
The crew declared a MAYDAY and selected squawk 7700.  They then briefed for a return 
to Runway 22 at Stansted.  After completing all the necessary single-engine operation 
checklists and landing performance calculations, they requested radar vectors for a normal 
ILS approach to Runway 22.  Following an uneventful approach and landing, the aircraft 
vacated the runway and the crew confirmed with the Airport Fire and Rescue Service 
Commander that the failed engine appeared normal.  During the landing rollout as the 
aircraft airspeed dropped below 70 kts an ‘eng 2 ovspd prot fault’ warning was triggered 
but this was not displayed on the ECAM.  The aircraft was then taxied to Maintenance 
Hangar 10 at Stansted and shut down in accordance with the relevant checklists.
Initial engineering investigation
The post-flight report was downloaded from the aircraft (Figure 1).  The Digital Flight Data 
Recorder (DFDR) was removed and downloaded, and the data provided to the aircraft 
manufacturer for further investigation.  The post-flight report indicated that additional failure 
messages had occurred during the flight which did not have an associated ECAM warning. 
The first was ‘eng ded altern/hc/eec2’, which indicated a failure of the Engine 2 Dedicated 
Alternator (EDA) or the electrical harness between the alternator and the Electronic Engine 
Control (EEC) unit.  Additionally, ‘fmu/hc/eec2’ and ‘propulsion system 2’ faults were 
also recorded.  The operator carried out Task 73-22-00-810-834-B ‘Failure of the engine 
dedicated alternator stator on engine 2’ from the aircraft Troubleshooting Manual (TSM) and 
the EEC, EDA and the Fuel Metering Unit (FMU) from the No 2 engine were removed and 
sent for further investigation.

Post-flight Report
Related maintenance events prior to the incident flight
On 23 May 2021 a water wash of both engines on the aircraft had been carried out in 
accordance with the Aircraft Maintenance Manual task 72-00-00-100-010-A.  During the 
required engine runs following this activity an ‘eng 2 ovspd prot fault’ had been triggered. 
In response the operator conducted two tasks from the aircraft troubleshooting manual, 
which were ‘loss of the N2 signal on engine 2’ and ‘loss of the N2 overspeed protection on 
engine 2’.  The EEC, FMU and EDA electrical harnesses were inspected on the No 2 engine 
and the engine 2 EEC A and B channels were tested.  No faults were identified by these 
checks and the aircraft was released back into service.

Recorded data showing the incident flight track
An overview of the relevant recorded data parameters for the incident flight, produced by 
the aircraft manufacturer, is shown in Figure 3.  This highlights the section where the No 2 
engine problem occurred.  From 08:27:46 hrs the EEC commanded EPR target rapidly 
increased on both engines to maintain the selected aircraft autopilot airspeed.  Whilst the 
EPR increased to match the EEC demand on engine No 1, the No 2 engine EPR began 
to decrease instead.  The ECAM FADEC fault warning was triggered at 08:27:53 hrs and 
the crew reported that the engine parameters remained as figures rather than switching 
to amber XX.  The actual engine No 2 EPR then remained at a constant value until the 
engine was shut down.

Aircraft information
The aircraft was fitted with two IAE V2527-A5 engines, which are Full Authority Digital 
Electronic Control (FADEC) equipped.  The FADEC system consists of a dual-channel 
EEC and the associated components and sensors to adjust and monitor the engine thrust 
and rotational speed.  The main engine parameters are the Engine Pressure Ratio2 (EPR) 
which indicates the thrust produced by the engine, N1 which is the speed of rotation of the 
low-pressure spool3 and the Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), which is one of the normal 
limiting parameters for the engine.  In normal mode the EEC computes the EPR figure 
required based on the throttle position or Flight Management Guidance Computer (FMGC) 
input, if autothrust is engaged. It then controls the fuel flow to the combustion chamber 
spray nozzles using the FMU, to achieve the target EPR.  If a fault results in the EPR figure 
not being available, the control system reverts to reversionary mode and uses N1 to control 
the engine.  N2 is the speed of rotation of the high-pressure spool.
Footnote

This is a ratio of the intake air pressure and the exhaust gas pressure, measured by sensors in the engine 
intake and low-pressure turbine exhaust.

The term spool refers to the entire compressor stages and turbine stages connected by a shaft.

The FMU has three mechanical control features, these are:
● 
The Fuel Metering Valve (FMV) which under normal operation modulates to 
deliver a metered fuel flow to the fuel nozzles based on the EEC command.
● 
An engine overspeed protection valve which works in series with the FMV 
to reduce the fuel flow to the spray nozzles if an overspeed of either the low-
pressure or high-pressure spool is sensed by the EEC.
● 
A Pressure Rising and Shut-off Valve (PRSOV) which is the main open/shut 
valve that controls fuel to the engine to facilitate starting and stopping of the 
engine. 
The FADEC system prevents an exceedance of the N1 or N2 spool by control logic which 
acts directly on the fuel flow commanded by the EEC. When triggered, the fuel flow is 
reduced but not completely shut off, with the residual fuel flow maintaining the engine at a 
power setting slightly below flight idle.  This fuel flow is fixed and does not respond to throttle 
position inputs.  The overspeed protection valve which achieves this is operated by a dual 
channel servo valve, commanded by either channel of the EEC.  The valve is hydraulically 
latched once engaged and can only be reset by shutting down the engine.
The EDA is a dedicated alternator fitted to and driven by the engine main gearbox to provide 
a dedicated Direct Current (DC) electrical power supply to the EEC, independent of the 
aircraft electrical systems. The EDA also supplies an N2 speed signal to the EEC and 
cockpit indication.  During engine start the EEC receives a 28V DC supply from the aircraft 
until the EDA takes over at approximately 10% N2. In the event of an EDA failure the EEC 
will switch back to the aircraft DC supply.
Operating procedures
An ‘eng 2 fadec fault’ warning on the ECAM indicates that both A and B channels of 
the indicated engine EEC have been lost.  In many cases this results in the complete 
loss of the indicated engine parameters, and the figures are replaced by an amber XX  
indication.  When this occurs the engine status can still be checked by referring to the 
engine’s associated indicated parameters such as hydraulic, electric, and pneumatic bleed 
systems.  If abnormal engine behaviour is identified the engine must be shut down using the 
master engine control lever.  The relevant FCOM checklist is shown in Figure 4.

Component investigation findings
EEC
The overhaul report for the removed EEC identified that some contamination was found on 
the pressure ports but stated that this was not linked to the issue reported on the incident 
flight.
EDA
The overhaul report confirmed that the component failed on test due to an insulation failure.  
It stated that this could cause an intermittent EEC electrical failure leading to temporary 
erroneous computations by the EEC.  It is possible that the loss of or erroneous behaviour 
of the N2 signal can cause a false activation of the overspeed protection within the EEC, 
but this would have been recorded as a separate fault on the post-flight report and reflected 
in the N2 parameter values in the flight data.  As these indicators were not present, it was 
ruled out as a possible cause for this incident.
FMU
The overhaul report identified the presence of internal fuel leaks around all three of the 
mechanical control valves within the FMU, with fuel also present in the electrical wiring cavity.  
These are known issues on the engine and are subject to ongoing product improvement 
processes by the engine manufacturer.

Previous similar events
Uncommanded (by the EEC) closure of the overspeed protection valve within the FMU has 
been experienced in previous similar events on other V2500 engines in service.  These 
events have resulted in either a FADEC, engine stall4, or engine overspeed protection fault 
warning being triggered.  In all cases the engine ran down to idle and neither physical 
movement of the throttle nor autothrust commands from the FMGC had any effect on the 
engine.  
Analysis
The manufacturer’s assessment of the failure messages seen on the post-flight report and 
the ECAM warning was that they were consistent with the reduction in EPR caused by 
an uncommanded activation of the overspeed protection valve in the FMU.  This reduced 
the fuel flow to the engine to a fixed level which was just below flight idle.   The flight data 
values recorded for N1 and N2 immediately prior to this were normal and confirmed that no 
actual overspeed had occurred, which would have resulted in the valve correctly operating.  
Once activated, the fixed flow rate through the overspeed protection valve cannot be varied 
by any input from the throttle or the FMGC.  As such, the apparently frozen parameters 
reported by the flight crew were an accurate indication of the engine status.  
The other ancillary engine indications and associated systems’ operating parameters 
recorded by the DFDR were all consistent with this.  The valve remained hydraulically 
latched while the engine was operating but would have reset after the engine was shut 
down. The final overspeed protection fault warning seen on the post-flight report is 
intentionally inhibited by the system until after touchdown and the aircraft airspeed has 
reduced below 80 kt, which is why it appeared to occur after the engine had been shut 
down.  The previous in-service events where the overspeed protection valve had operated 
without being commanded by the EEC, were very similar to this incident involving 9H-LOZ.  
It was not possible to confirm a definitive root cause for the activation of the overspeed 
protection valve from the evidence recovered by the investigation.  However, these events 
are all the subject of ongoing continued airworthiness activities by the engine and aircraft 
manufacturers.
Safety actions
It has been reported that the engine manufacturer has conducted investigations 
at component and system level to understand the cause of the inadvertent 
overspeed protection valve activations.  Definitive identification of the root cause 
has not been possible, but several factors have been identified as possible 
contributors.  These will be addressed as product improvement changes to the 
FMU and are targeted to be available in Q3 2022.  The aircraft manufacturer 
reported that progress on these issues is regularly communicated to operators 
of the engine during customer meetings, in which both the aircraft and engine 
manufacturers participate.

At the request of the operator of 9H-LOZ, the aircraft manufacturer also agreed 
to review the wording of the FCOM procedure for an ‘eng 1/2 fadec fault’ 
warning, to advise crews that the parameters will not always revert to ‘XX’ in 
the event of a problem occurring and may appear as frozen or abnormal values.
