SYNOPSIS 
 
 
On 29th June 2019, M/s Indigo Airbus A320-271 NEO aircraft VT-ITP, while operating 
a scheduled flight from Dehradun to Bengaluru diverted to Delhi due to high engine vibration 
& EGT overlimit during climb. The aircraft was under the command of an ATPL holder with 
another ATPL holder as co-pilot. There were 186 passengers on board the aircraft including 
04 cabin crew members. 
 
 
The aircraft took-off from Dehradun and flight was uneventful till climbing pass 12000 
feet altitude when a loud bang was heard by the crew 
warning triggered on ECAM. The Engine parameters i.e. N1 
vibrations was at 10 and N2 vibrations was at 7 and the EGT was noticed to be increasing 
past 1000oC. The Engine # 1 power was gradually brought back to Idle . The flight was 
levelled off at FL140. The crew carried out ECAM and QRH procedures. As the Engine 
parameters were abnormal, the crew decided to divert to Delhi. The aircraft was then diverted 
to Delhi. The aircraft landed safely at Delhi. On visual inspection of the engine inlet area and 
exhaust area, all blades of Low-Pressure Turbine 3rd stage were found damaged.  
 
The occurrence was classified as a Serious Incident and an investigation to investigate 
into the probable cause(s) was instituted under Rule 11 (1) of Aircraft (Investigation of 
Accidents and Incidents), Rules 2017.

1.16 Test and Research  
1.16.1 Tear Down Reports from Pratt & Whitney 
As per agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engine was replaced 
with a serviceable engine. The damaged LH engine was sent to OEM after the incident. The 
, Engine Disassembly and Inspection was carried 
out. There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades 
preceding this incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue, 
which had a developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was carried out 
by the OEM on the Engine ESN P770516. 
During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair, LPT Stage 3 and 1 were 
replaced with new as per the Shop Report made available by the OEM. TEC was replaced 
with new. The HPT and Combustor were upgraded to Block C configuration. HPC Rear Hub 
and Stage 8 IBR were replaced. The main gearbox was modified and EEC/PHMU software 
were upgraded as per applicable SBs. 
 
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru     
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and 
P770516 which had failed during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories 
(NAL), Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. ESN P770516 was fitted on 
VT-ITP at the time of incident. 
NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB. 
Following are the salient observations made in the failure report: -  
 
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at 
varying heights from the blade root platform.  
 
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the 
available part of the airfoil.  
 
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated 
chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.  
12 
 
 
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously 
in a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive 
failure such as fatigue.  
 
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the 
blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades, 
the fracture process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar 
separation in lamellar colonies. 
 
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3 
LPT blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material. 
The MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium 
(Al), 4% Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any metallurgical 
abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades. 
 
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture 
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl 
alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance 
properties compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used in 
this section of gas turbine engines.  
 
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae 
and isolated single phase gamma grains.  
 
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed 
that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack 
propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.

1.18.3 Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA. 
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with 
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must have 
at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the A320 NEO 
aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by 
31st January 2020.   
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which 
has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) engines. 
It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported. 
Thereafter, DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th 
November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding 
an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of 
Indigo. However, it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue 
to remain in force.   
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of 
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th 
May 2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st 
August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic. 
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had 
complied with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT 
modified engines.

ANALYSIS 
2.1 
General 
 
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.  
 
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft 
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of 
departure. Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit 
Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all 
higher Insp
guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme.  
 
2.2 
Circumstances Leading to the Incident 
VT-IPT was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. 770516. This engine was 
fitted with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and 
impact tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing 
and 
checklist/procedures for Engine Vibration and EGT overlimit and decided to divert to Delhi, 
as the engine parameters were abnormal. 
Crew informed ATC about diversion but no Emergency was declared by the crew. After 
obtaining necessary clearances from ATC, Delhi, the aircraft landed safely at Delhi. During 
post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine, LPT 3rd stage 
blades were found damaged.  
Incident was one amongst series of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did 
not carry out Technical Investigation into this case. 
 
2.3 
LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action. 
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it 
was determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based 
Titanium Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture toughness. 
17 
 
Although, the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys 
with engineered microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance 
properties. It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL, Bengaluru that 
LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had fractured 
instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any 
signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue. The fatigue test further confirmed that the 
material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack 
propagated instantaneously leading to fracture. It is, therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3 
blades failed in flight as these blades could not withstand possible impact from material 
liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously. This led to engine high vibration and 
EGT overlimit.   
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified 
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft) 
were installed with LPT modified engines.

CONCLUSION 
3.1 
Findings 
1. 
The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness, Certificate of Registration and the Certificate 
of Flight Release before operating the incident flight.  
2. 
Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight.  
3. 
There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft. 
4. 
During post flight inspection, while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine, 
i.e., inlet area and exhaust area of Engine # 1, Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades 
were found damaged. 
5. 
The incident was similar to series of other events where LPT 3rd stage blades failed 
during operation. The failure was considered to be a known issue by the OEM and no 
Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM. 
6. 
Failure Analysis of blades at NAL, Bengaluru indicated that the LPT 3rd stage blades 
material had less crack growth resistance and damage tolerance which causes the 
crack to propagate instantaneously after initiation leading to fracture.  
7. 
Pratt & Whitney has issued SB 72-00-0111 to Introduce of a new LPT 3rd stage blade 
made of a different material which is more resistant to impact damage. The airline has 
incorporated the said SB in all its affected aircraft.
