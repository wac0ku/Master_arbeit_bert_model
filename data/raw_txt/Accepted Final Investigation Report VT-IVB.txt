SYNOPSIS 
 
On 01st April 2019, M/s Indigo Airbus A320-271 (NEO) aircraft VT-IVB, while operating a 
scheduled flight from Jaipur to Hyderabad was involved in a Serious Incident of Air Turn Back 
due to Engine Stall during climb. The aircraft was under the command of a ATPL (FATA) holder 
with an ATPL holder co-pilot.  There were 128 passengers on board the aircraft including 04 cabin 
crew members.  
 
The aircraft took-off from Jaipur and had an uneventful flight until climbing pass 14600 feet 
altitude, when a loud bang was heard by the crew and subsequently, ENG # 1 STALL  ECAM 
triggered. This was followed by ENG 1 HGH VIB  and ENG 1 EGT OVERLIMIT  on ECAM. The 
Engine N1 and N2 vibrations was at 10 and the EGT was noticed to be increasing past 1000oC. 
The crew carried out ECAM and QRH procedures. As the Engine parameters were abnormal, the 
crew decided to divert back to Jaipur. The aircraft was then diverted back to Jaipur. The aircraft 
landed safely at Jaipur. After landing, ENG 1 OIL CHIP DETECTED  ECAM triggered. While 
turning into bay, ENG 1 FAIL  and ENG 1 START FAULT  ECAMs triggered. On visual inspection 
of the engine inlet area and exhaust area, all blades of LPT 3rd stage were found damaged.  
 
The occurrence was classified as Serious Incident and an investigation to investigate into 
the probable cause(s) of the serious incident, was instituted under Rule 11 (1) of Aircraft 
(Investigation of Accidents and Incidents), Rules 2017.

1.16 Test and Research  
1.16.1 Tear Down Reports from Pratt & Whitney 
As per agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engine was replaced with 
a serviceable engine. The damaged LH engine was sent to OEM after the incident. The Engine 
ut. There 
were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades preceding this 
incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue, which had a 
developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM on 
the incident Engine (ESN P770187). The engine was repaired by replacing the defective 
hardware.  
 
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru    
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and P770516 
which had failed during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), 
Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. ESN P770187 was fitted on VT-IVB at 
the time of incident. NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to 
AAIB. Following are the salient observations made in the failure report: -  
 
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at varying 
heights from the blade root platform.  
 
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the 
available part of the airfoil.  
13 
 
 
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated chevron 
marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.  
 
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously in 
a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure 
such as fatigue.  
 
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the blades 
was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades, the fracture 
process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar separation in lamellar 
colonies. 
 
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3 LPT 
blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material. The 
MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium (Al), 4% 
Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any metallurgical 
abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades. 
 
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture 
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys 
with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance properties 
compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used in this section of 
gas turbine engines.  
 
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae and 
isolated single phase gamma grains.  
 
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed that 
the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack 
propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.  
 
1.17 Organizational and Management Information

1.18.1 Typical Snags Reported in PW1127G-JM Engines  
Since the induction of PW1127G-JM engines in India in the year 2016, there have been a 
number of snags reported on aircraft fitted with these engines. Most of the snags were repetitive 
in nature. In order to prevent reoccurrence of such failures, Pratt & Whitney came up with some 
rectification actions/modifications for each snag.  
The following table depicts the Typical Snags and Rectification Action/Modification carried 
out by Pratt & Whitney along with the status of action taken by M/s Indigo as of 17th Nov 2020:

As per the above table, it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents corresponds 
to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight. As per agreement between 
M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engines were replaced by serviceable engines. All engines 
involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were quarantined after the occurrence and 
sent to OEM (Pratt & Whitney) facility in USA and Germany for repair. 
 Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical investigation as 
the events were similar to various prior occurrences and considered to be a known issue. The 
Disassembly and Tear down report of all these Engine was shared with AAIB through Accredited 
Representative of NTSB.

1.18.3 
Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA. 
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with 
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must have at 
least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the A320 NEO aircraft 
fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by 31st January 
2020.   
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which has 
been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) engines. It was 
also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported. Thereafter, 
17 
 
DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th November 2019 
and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding an existing aircraft 
with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of Indigo. However, it 
said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue to remain in force.   
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of 
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th May 
2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st August 
2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic. 
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had complied 
with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT modified engines.

ANALYSIS 
2.1 
General 
 
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.  
 
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft held 
a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of departure. 
Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit Inspections were 
carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all higher Inspection 
in Maintenance Programme.  
 
2.2 
Circumstances Leading to the Incident 
VT-IVB was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. 770187. This engine was fitted 
with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and impact 
tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing Flight Level 
146. A loud bang was heard by the crew. Subsequently, ENG 1 STALL
triggered on ECAM. 
This was followed by ENG 1 HGH VIB  and ENG 1 EGT OVERLIMIT  on ECAM. The crew 
followed ECAM actions and QRH checklist/procedures for Engine Stall, Engine Vibration and 
EGT overlimit. The Engine parameters were observed to be abnormal and the crew decided to 
18 
 
divert back to Jaipur. No Emergency was declared by the crew. Aircraft made a safe landing at 
Jaipur after obtaining necessary clearances from ATC.  
During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine, 
Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged. Incident was one amongst series 
of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical Investigation into this 
case. 
 
2.3 
LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action. 
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it was 
determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based Titanium 
Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture toughness. Although, 
the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with engineered 
microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance properties. It was confirmed 
during the fractography study conducted by NAL, Bengaluru that LPT 3rd stage blades of the 
Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner and 
none of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue.  
The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack growth 
resistance and after initiation, the crack propagated instantaneously leading to fracture. It is, 
therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades could not withstand 
possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously. This led to 
engine high vibration and EGT overlimit.   
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified 
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were 
installed with LPT modified engines.
