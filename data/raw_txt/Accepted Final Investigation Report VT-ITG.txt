SYNOPSIS 
 
 
On 02nd April 2019, M/s Indigo Airbus A320-271 (NEO) aircraft VT-ITG, while 
operating a scheduled flight from Pune to Nagpur was involved in an Air Turn Back due to 
Engine Stall during climb. The aircraft was under the command of an ATPL holder with a a 
CPL holder co-pilot. There were 93 passengers on board the aircraft including 04 cabin crew 
members. 
 
The aircraft took off from Pune and flight was uneventful till climbing pass 14300 feet 
altitude when a loud bang was heard by the crew from left side. Subsequently, Engine No 
# 1 STALL  ECAM was triggered. This was followed by ENG 1 EGT OVERLIMIT  and 
on ECAM. The Engine parameters i.e., N1 and N2 vibrations were observed to be 
at 10 and 7 respectively, and the EGT was noticed to be increasing past 1000oC. The Engine 
# 1 power was brought back to Idle. The crew carried out ECAM and QRH procedures. 
Owing to abnormal engine parameters, the crew decided to return to Pune. No emergency 
was declared and the aircraft landed safely at Pune after obtaining permission from ATC. 
On visual inspection of the engine inlet area and exhaust area, all blades of LPT 3rd stage 
were found damaged.  
 
The occurrence was classified as Serious Incident and an investigation to investigate 
into the probable cause(s) of the serious incident, was instituted under Rule 11 (1) of Aircraft 
(Investigation of Accidents and Incidents), Rules 2017.

1.16.1 Tear Down Reports from Pratt & Whitney 
As per agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engine was replaced 
with a serviceable engine. The damaged LH engine was sent to OEM after the incident. The 
out. There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades 
preceding this incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue, 
which had a developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was carried 
out by the OEM on the incident Engine (ESN P770530). 
During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair, The 3rd stage LPT blades 
and disk were replaced IAW SB 72-0111. The TEC and LPT case were replaced with new 
due to excessive damage. Some 1st stage and 2nd stage LPT blades were also found 
damaged and replaced with new. Borescope inspection of the HPC Tie shaft ID revealed 
HPC Tie shaft scoring and HPC was disassembled to replace the HPC shaft. The combustor 
was replaced with new Block C hardware and the 1st stage HPT blades and BOAS were 
replaced with new. The main gearbox was also modified per SB 72-00-0129 and the 
EEC/PHMU software upgraded to FCS5.0 per SB 73-00-0037. 
 
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru    
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and 
P770516 which had failed during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories 
(NAL), Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. ESN P770530 was fitted on 
VT-ITG at the time of incident. NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted 
a report to AAIB. Following are the salient observations made in the failure report: -  
 
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at 
varying heights from the blade root platform.  
 
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the 
available part of the airfoil.  
13 
 
 
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated 
chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.  
 
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured 
instantaneously in a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures 
of progressive failure such as fatigue.  
 
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the 
blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades, 
the fracture process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar 
separation in lamellar colonies. 
 
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3 
LPT blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material. 
The MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium 
(Al), 4% Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any 
metallurgical abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades. 
 
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture 
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl 
alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance 
properties compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used 
in this section of gas turbine engines.  
 
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae 
and isolated single phase gamma grains.  
 
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed 
that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the 
crack propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.

1.18.3 Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA. 
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with 
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must 
have at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the 
A320 NEO aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both 
its engines by 31st January 2020.   
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which 
has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) 
engines. It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be 
imported. Thereafter, DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order 
dated 25th November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent 
of grounding an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft 
in the fleet of Indigo. However, it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the 
same will continue to remain in force.   
17 
 
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of 
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th 
May 2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 
31st August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic. 
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had 
complied with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT 
modified engines.

ANALYSIS 
2.1 
General 
 
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.  
 
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft 
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of 
departure. Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit 
Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and 
guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme.  
 
2.2 
Circumstances Leading to the Incident 
VT-ITG was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. 770530. This engine was 
fitted with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and 
impact tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing 
ECAM actions and QRH checklist/procedures for Engine Stall, Engine Vibration and EGT 
overlimit. The Engine # 1 power was brought to idle. Observing Engine parameters to be 
abnormal, the crew decided to return to Pune. No Emergency was declared by the crew. 
The aircraft landed safely at Pune after obtaining necessary clearances from ATC, Pune.

During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved 
engine, Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged. Incident was one 
amongst series of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical 
Investigation into this case. 
 
2.3 
LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action. 
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it 
was determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based 
Titanium Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture 
toughness. Although, the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version 
of TiAl alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage 
tolerance properties. It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL, 
Bengaluru that LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had 
fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of 
any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue.  
The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack 
growth resistance and after initiation, the crack propagated instantaneously leading to 
fracture. It is, therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades 
could not withstand possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured 
instantaneously. This led to engine high vibration and EGT overlimit.   
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified 
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft) 
were installed with LPT modified engines.
