AAIB Field Investigation
Synopsis
The aircraft was on a scheduled flight from London Stansted Airport to Vienna International 
Airport, Austria.  Shortly after the takeoff roll was commenced it was rejected, due to a 
contained failure of the left engine, and the aircraft was brought to a stop on the runway.  
Just as the flight crew were about to taxi the aircraft off the runway, an evacuation was 
commanded by the Senior Flight Attendant.  The investigation identified several factors that 
contributed to this decision.  Ten passengers were treated for minor injuries that occurred 
during the evacuation and there was a risk of serious injury due to one of the engines 
running during the evacuation.  The operator has taken several safety actions, principally 
based around the training of its flight attendants. Two Safety Recommendations regarding 
passenger evacuation have been made in this report. 
The left engine experienced a contained failure following the rupture and release of several 
blades from the first stage of the high-pressure compressor.  The investigation found that 
the blades fractured as a result of high-cycle fatigue loading which initiated in the dovetail 
(part of the blade root), due to a once-per-revolution aerodynamic excitation.  An inlet guide 
vane lever arm had been improperly assembled which led to aerodynamic excitation of the 
passing blades and the resulting forces exceeded the design loads of the blades.

History of the flight
The aircraft was on a scheduled flight from London Stansted Airport to Vienna International 
Airport, Austria, having previously flown in from Vienna about an hour earlier.  The 
commander was the PF for the sector and it was a line training sector for the co-pilot. 
There were five flight attendants1 (FAs), including an additional crew member (ACM)2.
The aircraft pushed back and taxied out to Runway 22 without event.  ATC clearance was 
then given for the aircraft to line up and take off.  At the time it was dark outside, and the 
weather was clear with the wind from 160° at 5 kt.  In the cabin, the lights had been dimmed 
for takeoff, as is normal practice.
Flight crew observations
Having lined up on the runway, the commander set the throttles to full power/toga3 and 
commenced the takeoff roll.  About one second after the co-pilot said “thrust set”, at a 
groundspeed of 31 kt, a loud bang was heard and the aircraft immediately drifted towards 
the left of the runway.  The commander said “stop stop stop” and rejected the takeoff.  
The aircraft came to a stop between the centreline and the left side of the runway.  The 
commander then set the parking brake, selected the public address system (PA) button and 
announced “attention crew: on station”4 twice.  The co-pilot then informed ATC that they 
were stopping on the runway and then completed the actions for ‘ENG 1 FAIL’ and ‘ENG 1 
REVERSER UNLOCKED’ electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) messages; there 
were no fire indications.  The left engine was shutdown at 2006:23 hrs.
After the ECAM messages had been actioned the commander contacted the RFFS, who 
were quickly on the scene, on frequency 121.6 MHz to confirm that there were no signs of 
fire visible from the outside.  As a result, it was decided to vacate the runway using the thrust 
from the right engine and he asked ATC for clearance to do so.
At 2007:21 hrs, just as the commander was about to make a PA to instruct the FA to return 
to normal operations, he noticed an amber ‘DOOR L [LEFT] FWD [FORWARD] CABIN’ 
caution message illuminated on the ECAM.  At first, he thought it was a fault but then 
saw the evacuation slide deployed at Door L1 out the left cockpit window and passengers 
moving across the front of the aircraft.  The commander then had a conversation with the 
Senior Flight Attendant (SFA), over the interphone, during which the commander asked why 
the evacuation had been initiated.  She replied that she believed he had ordered one, which 
he denied.  After this conversation, the APU was started and the right engine, which was still 
operating while the evacuation was underway, was selected off at 2009:38 hrs.
Footnote
1 
The operator refers to its cabin crew as flight attendants.
2 
An ACM is a member of the flight attendant team who is not designated an operational role.  She was having 
a familiarisation flight having recently completed her training.
3 
It was a requirement of the operator to do a full power/TOGA takeoff, for maintenance purposes, on the first 
day of each month.  The flight crew elected to carry this out on the sector from Stansted to Vienna.
4 
In an emergency on the ground, this command is issued as an advance warning.  Upon this command, flight 
attendants should immediately move to their doors, remain on high alert and wait for additional commands 
from the cockpit.

The co-pilot then went into the cabin while the commander stayed in the cockpit and 
maintained contact with ATC and the RFFS.  In the cabin the co-pilot found no passengers 
but noted a lot of baggage near the exits.  There were also only three of the five FA present, 
as two had left the aircraft to assist the passengers on the ground.  The commander then 
requested they return to the aircraft, which they subsequently did.
Flight attendants’ observations
Soon after the takeoff roll started, all the FAs heard a loud noise and felt the aircraft drift 
to the left before coming to a stop a few seconds later.  All except the SFA heard the 
commander announce “attention crew: on station” over the PA after which they all 
stood up at their assigned exits.  At the front of the cabin the SFA stood in the aisle facing 
rearwards, while FA2 looked out of the Door 1L window.  At the rear of the aircraft FA4 
and FA3 looked out of Door 3L and 3R respectively while the ACM stood in the middle. 
No danger was observed; they thus awaited further instructions from the commander.

The SFA then tried to call FA3, in the rear of the aircraft, using the interphone, to check if 
everything was alright.  However, when FA3 stood up, his crew swivel seat displaced the 
attached handset from its stowage and its cable became trapped in the now folded seat5. 
This caused the crew high/low chime6 in the cabin to be suppressed so it was difficult for 
the SFA to attract FA3’s attention.  There then followed an exchange between the SFA and 
FA3 which resulted in the SFA commanding an evacuation over the PA.  See the Flight 
attendants’ comments section for details of this exchange.  Upon hearing the command, the 
FAs and passengers commenced the evacuation.
When FA3 opened Door 3R the escape slide inflated and floated in the air, close to the 
horizontal, but he did not understand why at the time.  However, knowing it was unsafe to 
use, he blocked the exit.  The slide at Door 3L inflated correctly and FA3 and 4 shouted their 
evacuation commands to the passengers as the passengers exited the aircraft.  Several 
passengers brought hand baggage with them, but it was removed from them and placed 
by Door 3R.  A similar situation with baggage occurred at Doors 1L and 1R.  See the 
Emergency evacuation section for more on the evacuation.
Once all the passengers had left the aircraft, the FAs checked the cabin.  FA3 then instructed 
the ACM to exit the aircraft to assist the passengers.  He was about to follow her but the SFA 
instructed all the FAs to remain on the aircraft.  Shortly thereafter the FAs found out that the 
evacuation was not necessary.  As a result, FA3 left the aircraft to find the ACM to inform 
her to return to the aircraft.
The airport RFFS were quickly in attendance and were subsequently joined by local authority 
ambulances.
Two injured passengers were taken to hospital and several were treated for minor injuries 
at the scene.  The passengers were subsequently taken to the airport terminal by buses.  
The majority of them were able to travel on to Vienna on a replacement aircraft later that 
evening.
The aircraft was subsequently towed off the runway to a remote parking position.
Flight attendants’ comments
All the FAs were initially interviewed by the AAIB the following day.  Further interviews were 
later conducted with the SFA, FA3 and FA4.
SFA’s comments
The SFA stated that the noise of the engine failure was very loud.  The noise and the 
movement of the aircraft to the left scared her.  She reported that her attention was focused 
on the noises made by the aircraft and she did not hear the commander announce “attention 
crew: on station” over the PA.

AAIB-25599
The SFA reported that she stood up when the other FAs stood up.  She was aware of all 
the passengers looking at her and felt under pressure because of this.  She was feeling 
“shocked” and overwhelmed.  She attempted to contact FA3 at the rear of the aircraft, initially 
without success.  She reported that it felt like a long time that she was trying to contact 
FA3.  There was confusion while they attempted to communicate using a combination of 
the interphone, hand signals and the PA.  The darkness in the cabin made the use of hand 
signals difficult and she could not see well enough to understand signals given by FA3.
The SFA commented that she intended to obtain information from FA3 to help her decide 
whether an evacuation was needed.  She added that FA3 said he had seen flames and 
sparks from the engine.  Her impression was that FA3 was “scared and shocked” and FA2 
was “completely shocked”.  She stated she attempted to discuss what to do with FA3.  
However, at some point during this exchange she said “evacuate, evacuate, evacuate” 
over the interphone and subsequently over the PA.
The SFA stated that she knew the guidance from the operator’s flight safety manual about 
the circumstances to initiate an evacuation but was not thinking about this at the time.  See 
Flight attendants’ training and experience section.  The SFA explained that she generally 
had very limited interaction with the pilots and a limited understanding of their responsibilities 
in an emergency.  She said, “For me, it was the door closed, I have nothing to do with them.” 
And she did not think about contacting the flight crew at any point.
FA3’s comments
FA3 reported that he heard a bang when the engine failed and saw red and yellow lights 
through the passenger windows for one or two seconds.  He recalled that FA4 told him and 
the ACM to stay calm and expect instructions from the flight crew.
After the “attention crew: on station” announcement he fumbled with the seat when 
standing up.  It closed very fast, knocking the interphone from its cradle.  The interphone 
fell to the floor and the cable became trapped in the seat.
The next communication he was aware of was the SFA asking “Can you hear me?” over the 
PA.  FA3 said he subsequently had difficultly freeing the interphone.  He stated that when 
he was eventually able to speak to the SFA she said “evacuate, evacuate, evacuate”.  He 
did not understand why she would command an evacuation over the interphone and felt he 
could not open the door alone, so he told her to announce it over the PA.  
FA3 commented that in this situation “A few seconds feels like minutes” and it is difficult for 
FAs waiting after the “attention crew: on station” command because they do not know 
what is going on in the flight deck and feel responsibility for the passengers’ safety.
FA4’s comments
FA4 reported that she started briefing FA3 and the ACM after the engine failure.  She told 
them to stay calm and wait for the “attention crew: on station” command and not to open 
the doors.  She explained that she did this because she was aware of their inexperience 
and to keep herself calm.

She did not follow all the conversation between FA3 and the SFA, but she remembered 
FA3 saying that he had seen fire outside.  She heard him tell the SFA to say the evacuation 
command “out loud”.  She attempted to contact the SFA via the other interphone at the 
rear of the aircraft but was unsuccessful.  Then the SFA announced “evacuate,�evacuate,�
evacuate” over the PA.  
FA4 initially hesitated to begin the evacuation but when she realised that FA3 had already 
opened the Door 3R, she opened Door 3L.
Emergency evacuation
AAIB passenger questionnaire
The airport operator commented that it has a requirement in its Terminal Emergency 
Orders for the AAIB’s passenger questionnaire to be distributed to passengers after 
an evacuation.  However, none were given to the passengers on this occasion as an 
alternative aircraft had been sourced by the parent company of the operator.  As a result, 
the airport operator’s staff were busy organising those passengers that wanted to complete 
their journey to Vienna.  Most passengers subsequently completed their journey later that 
evening.
After the accident the AAIB emailed its Passenger Questionnaire to the 169 passengers; 
46 (27%) were subsequently returned.
Injuries
Local authority ambulances attended the scene.  They reported that 10 patients were treated 
for minor injuries at the scene by paramedics.  Most of the injuries were cuts, grazes, bruises 
and sprains.  Two were subsequently taken to a local hospital for further treatment but were 
later discharged.  While the physical injuries sustained were minor, a few passengers stated 
on the questionnaires that they have suffered from post-traumatic stress which they were 
receiving treatment for.
Passengers’ comments
Several of the passengers commented that after the aircraft came to a stop the FAs seemed 
to have problems with the PA.  Additionally, they used the PA to communicate between the 
front and rear of the aircraft in German.  Four passengers commented that they either did 
not hear or did not fully understand the command to evacuate.
Numerous passengers also commented that the aisle and Doors 2L and 2R and the overwing 
exits, were impeded as people were trying to take their baggage from under seats and 
overhead bins.  As a result, passengers were shouted at by some to leave their baggage 
behind.  One passenger thought that about half of the passengers took their hand baggage 
with them.  Images of passengers leaving the aircraft with baggage from the right overwing 
exit were captured by the RFFS’s onboard infrared CCTV camera (Figure 2).

Of those passengers that used Door 2R, several commented that they were either nearly 
blown over, or were blown over several times by the jet exhaust from the right engine, with 
some of their belongings blown away.  Figure 1 shows passengers crossing behind the 
engine exhaust could have been exposed to ‘wind’ speeds of 65 mph or greater, even with 
the engines running at idle.
A320 emergency evacaution checklist
The ‘EMER[GENCY] EVAC[UATION]’ checklist from the A320 Quck Reference Handbook 
(QRH) (Figure 3) was what the flight crew would have actioned had the commander 
elected to command an evacaution.

Safety studies regarding passenger behaviour during evacuation
The issue of passengers taking baggage with them during an evacuation has been well 
documented.
An NTSB safety study on evacuation of commercial aircraft7 stated that ‘Passengers exiting 
with carry-on baggage were the most frequently cited obstruction to evacuation.’  The study 
collated questionnaires from passengers who had been evacuated and found that almost 
50% attempted to remove a bag during the evacuation.  The primary reason given was to 
keep hold of high value items in the bags such as money, keys and medicine.

A similar safety study by the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) of Canada8 studied 
21 evacuations and found nine in which passengers stopped to retrieve carry-on baggage 
and attempted to take it with them as they exited the aircraft, despite being told not to by 
the flight attendants.
An EASA-sponsored study on CS-25 cabin safety requirements published in 20099 identified 
13 evacuations in which evacuees attempted to collect cabin baggage and five where they 
carried baggage out of exits or down the slides.
In 2018 the Royal Aeronautical Society published a paper entitled ‘Emergency Evacuation 
of Commercial Passenger Aeroplanes10’.  It highlighted many of the factors that influence 
the success of an evacuation, including the tendency for passengers to take baggage with 
them.  The paper identified six accidents where passengers evacuated with baggage.
These studies identified accidents and incidents where passengers evacuated with baggage.  
Appendix 1 provides a list of those cases where the full report was available online and 
described the issues with the passengers’ behaviour.
The Royal Aeronautical Society commented ‘This trend appears to be increasing and can 
only be exacerbated by the increasing volume of cabin baggage being permitted by some 
operators for commercial reasons.’
The paper stated that operator practice of charging for hold baggage has resulted in there 
being more baggage in the cabin and an increased number of passengers travelling with 
only cabin baggage.
The Royal Aeronautical Society paper emphasises the point that passenger behaviour is 
not strongly influenced by briefing or flight attendant instructions and recommends:
‘Aviation�authorities�should�consider�the�feasibility�of�introducing�a�certification�
requirement�for�a�means�of�remotely�locking,�from�the�flight�deck,�overhead�bins�

Safety recommendations following previous evacuations
On 16 April 2012 an Airbus A330, registration G-VSXY11, was en route from London Gatwick 
Airport to McCoy International Airport in Orlando, USA, when a smoke warning in the aft 
cargo compartment illuminated.  After a successful emergency landing an emergency 
evacuation was ordered.  The AAIB report concluded that some passengers slowed 
their own evacuation due to issues with cabin baggage.  As a result, the following Safety 
Recommendation was made:
Safety Recommendation 2014-005
It is recommended that the European Aviation Safety Agency amend AMC1 
CAT.OP.MPA.170, ‘Passenger briefing’, to ensure briefings emphasise the 
importance of leaving hand baggage behind in an evacuation.
The EASA’s response to this Safety Recommendation was that it had evaluated this safety 
issue within the framework of rulemaking tasks RMT.0516 and RMT.0517 Updating Air 
OPS Regulation (EU) No 965/2012/Implementing Rules and related Acceptable Means of 
Compliance (AMC) & Guidance Material (GM).
The outcome of the evaluation was contained in EASA Executive Director (ED) 
Decision 2017/008/R, which was published on the EASA website on 30 March 2017.
The ED Decision introduced new text under AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.170 on ‘passenger briefing’ 
which states that, before takeoff and before landing, passengers should be briefed on/
reminded of the importance of leaving hand baggage behind in case of evacuation.  This is 
stated in Section 1.2.12, Passenger�briefing, of the operator’s Flight Safety Manual.
The ED Decision also introduced guidance under GM2 CAT.OP.MPA.170, (f)(5)(vi) 
Passenger�briefing�-�safety�briefing�material which states that the operator should consider 
including information on leaving hand baggage behind, in its safety briefing material on 
emergency exits.  The operator of OE-LOA had this information on its passenger safety 
cards that were in each seat pocket of the aircraft and in Section 1.1.12.4, Safety card, of 
its Flight Safety Manual.
The EASA stated that emergency evacuations had also been captured as a candidate 
safety issue within their safety risk portfolio for commercial air transport (fixed wing), as part 
of the EASA’s safety risk management process.

CS-25 requirements for evacuation emergency demonstration
CS-25.80312 requires that all passengers and crew can be evacuated within 90 seconds 
and compliance must be shown using a demonstration.  Appendix J of CS-25 specifies 
test criteria and procedures for the demonstration.  It must be conducted in the dark with a 
certain mixture of passengers in terms of age and gender.  It requires a proportion of cabin 
baggage and other items to be placed in the cabin to act as minor obstructions.  It does not 
require any of the simulated passengers to retrieve their own baggage and attempt to leave 
the aircraft with it.
Flight attendants’ training and experience
The SFA initially qualified as a FA in May 2017 and flew from then until November 2017 
for the previous operator13.  Between December 2017 and March 2018 she did not fly due 
to the previous operator going bankrupt and the current operator commencing operations.  
She resumed working for the current operator who had taken over as the AOC holder.  She 
completed SFA training and was promoted to SFA in May 2018.
FA4 also worked for the previous operator and had a period of not flying between 
December 2017 and March 2018.  All the other FAs were recruited after this.  The ACM was 
completing her first familiarisation flight following her initial training.
The operator reported that the initial FA training course was designed for 20 to 25 trainees, 
though there was no formal limit.  It consisted of a six-week classroom-based course and 
practical training using a Cabin Emergency Evacuation Trainer (CEET)14.  The SFA’s initial 
FA course was attended by 39 trainees.  Her SFA course was a five-day classroom-based 
course.  
Though the SFA and FA4 were initially trained by a previous operator, there was a 
lot of continuity of practice and staff between the previous and current operators.  All 
practical training scenarios in the CEET resulted in a simulated evacuation.  The initial 
and senior training received by these FAs did not include examples of the pilots’ activities 
when responding to an emergency or the potential effects of startle and surprise on 
FA performance.
The operator did not have their own FA simulation training facility and relied on the use of a 
facility owned by another operator.
All FA training met the relevant requirements and was approved by the national aviation 
authority.

Organisational information
The operator’s Operations Manual, Part A, stated: ‘the�designated�senior�flight�attendant�
must have at least one year’s experience as an operating cabin crew member.’
The operator did not have any requirements for the composition of the FA team in terms of 
experience.
Emergency evacuation initiation
Normally the commander would initiate an emergency evacuation using the PA.  However, 
FAs can command an evacuation under certain circumstances.  These are stated in the 
operator’s Flight Safety Manual:
‘1.16.1 Carrying out an evacuation
…
If no evacuation command is issued from the cockpit, and there is no doubt 
that an evacuation is necessary, the Senior FA or any other FA can initiate an 
evacuation under the following conditions:
a)�
Immediate�danger�(fire,�smoke,�explosion,�water�etc.)
b) 
Cockpit�crew�is�incapacitated�(injured,�not�on�board)
c) 
Communications�down�due�to�heavy�damage�to�aircraft’
Aircraft information
Evacuation routes
The slides available on the aircraft are shown in Figure 1.  FAs do not supervise the overwing 
exits but give a brief to those passengers adjacent to them about their duties in the event of 
an evacuation before departure.
FA3 crew seat and cabin interphones
There were three interphone handsets located in the aircraft; one at the front and two at the 
rear.  
A rear aisle swivel seat folded away from the wall and locked into position to provide a 
forward-facing view into the passenger cabin.  When the release latch was lifted, the seat 
automatically folded back into the stowed position (Figure 4).
The rear interphone intended for use by FA3 was located on the aisle swivel seat.

Figure 6
Interphone handset
Figure 6 shows the buttons available on the passenger cabin interphones.  It was possible 
to call the FA3 interphone handset individually from the front handset using the aft r[ight] 
attnd [flight attendant] button or to call all handsets together using the all attnd button. 
If the handset was called individually, and it was not fitted on its cradle, the attention getters 
of the chime and panel lights would not activate.
According to the FAs, it was common for the interphone handsets to fall from their cradles.  
The aircraft was serviceable and there were no entries in the aircraft technical log or cabin 
log about the interphone.  An example interphone on the folding seat was inspected in the 
CEET during the investigation and it was easily dislodged from the cradle when the seat 
was released to fold back.  The equipment manufacturer was informed about this during 
the investigation.  There were no previous reports in their in-service experience database of 
seat-mounted cabin interphones becoming dislodged when the seat was released.
Evacuation signal
The aircraft was fitted with an evacuation signal.  The operator’s procedure was for the 
evacuation signal to be set only to be activated from the cockpit and not from the passenger 
cabin.   
Recorded information
The FDR and CVR were recovered from the aircraft and downloaded at the AAIB.  Both 
recorders captured the event and the recordings have been used to help write the History 
of�the�flight�section.  The CVR contained a number of discussions between the flight crew 
and the FA, but not the PA in the cabin.

The CVR is a 4-channel recorder which records audio from the commander, co-pilot, cockpit 
third occupant station and the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM).  Each of the occupants 
can control their audio (and subsequent CVR recording) using a dedicated Audio Control 
Panel (ACP).  If the PA recept[ion] is selected on an ACP, the CVR will record any PA 
announcements.
The operator’s FCOM contains a number of the checklist items required to be completed 
prior to each flight.  One of these items is to ensure the third occupants ACP is set to enable 
audio from the PA system so the CVR will record it:
THIRD OCCUPANT AUDIO CONTROL PANEL
PA knob…………………………………………............……………..RECIEPT
- This allows cabin attendant announcements to be recorded on the CVR.
- For proper recording, set volume at or above medium range.
The co-pilot stated that he checked this item before the flight.
It is believed recept is deselected when there is a third occupant, as this avoids all 
PA announcements being heard through their headset.
A check of the system by the operator’s engineers found it to be serviceable.
Engine aspects
General description
The CFM 56-5B engine is a two spool, high bypass ratio turbofan engine.  It has a 
single-stage fan and a four-stage booster which together comprise the LP compressor 
(LPC) and a nine-stage HP compressor (HPC).  The LPC is driven by a four-stage LP 
turbine and the HPC is driven by a single-stage HP turbine.  It has a Full Authority Digital 
Engine Control (FADEC) which provides engine control and monitoring via the Engine 
Control Unit.
The HPC increases the pressure of the air as it passes from stage to stage, in order to supply 
the combustor section.  It is comprised of a rotor, front stator and rear stator.  The Variable 
Stator Vane (VSV) system, located at the forward end of the HPC (Figure 8), positions the 
Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV) and the stage 1, 2 and 3 stator vanes to the appropriate angle to 
optimise the airflow over the HPC rotor blades (Figure 9).
The VSV actuation system consists of two hydraulic actuators located at the 2 o’clock and 
8 o’clock positions, a series of bellcranks, tie rods and four actuation rings (one for each 
stage) made in two halves.  The actuation ring halves are connected at the split-line of the 
compressor casing by a connecting link, to which the actuator tie rods are connected.  Each 
vane is connected to the actuation ring by a lever arm.  The connecting links and actuation 
rings rotate circumferentially about the horizontal axis of the compressor in response to 
actuator inputs and this movement is transmitted through the lever arms to change the 
angular position of the vanes.

The Variable Bleed Valve (VBV) system is located forward of the HPC.  It regulates the 
amount of air discharged from the LPC into the HPC.

Engine maintenance history
The left engine, engine serial number (ESN) 697283, was manufactured in 2007 and had 
been fitted to the aircraft since new.  The aircraft had been leased to an Indonesian operator 
prior to entering service with the current operator.  During the return-from-lease inspection 
several defects were identified with the engine which resulted in its removal and subsequent 
repair at an engine overhaul facility in Indonesia.  During the repair process, the IGV and 
VSV actuation rings were split to remove the top half of the HPC case (front stator), allowing 
access to replace two damaged HPC blades.  This involved disassembly of the connecting 
links on the IGV and VSV actuation rings.
The IGV and VSV actuation rings and connecting links were reassembled after reinstallation 
of the HPC case.  No defects were noted during the post-repair inspections or the subsequent 
engine test cell runs and the engine was refitted to the aircraft. 
The operator took delivery of the aircraft, registered as OE-LOA, on 22 December 2018.  
No maintenance was performed on the left engine between then and the accident, other 
than routine oil replenishment, and there were no relevant defects in the technical log.  At 
the time of the accident the engine had accumulated 513 operating hours and 220 cycles 
since the engine repair.
Engine examination
The aircraft had been moved from the runway but debris which had exited the left 
engine was collected from the runway by the Airport Authority and provided to the AAIB 
(Figure 10).  The items collected included multiple IGVs, fragments of compressor blades 
and fragments of engine acoustic liner.

Preliminary examination of the engine identified that the engine casing had not been 
breached but that engine parts, predominantly IGVs, had exited the engine through the 
VBV louvre panels.  Other parts, later identified as IGV vanes and HP compressor stage 1 
blade fragments, had collected in the VBV sumps.  The engine centrebody exhibited a 
circumferential crack running around approximately 270° of its diameter.
Debris retrieved from inside the engine cowlings was identified as fragments of washers 
and bushings from the IGV and variable stator vane (VSV) actuation rings.
Engine borescope inspection
An engine borescope inspection identified that the fan blades and LPC booster stages 1 to 
3 were undamaged but the trailing edges of all LPC stage 4 blades and stators exhibited 
substantial impact damage including dents, tears and missing material.  The HPC rotor could 
not be rotated, but it was evident that all IGVs were missing and extensive damage had 
been sustained by all HPC stage 1 blades.  The downstream stages of the HPC exhibited 
extensive damage and some stage 1 VSVs were missing. 
Engine strip examination
General
An engine strip examination was conducted at an approved engine overhaul facility under 
the supervision of the AAIB. 
External examination
A single IGV lever arm in the 3 o’clock position (aft looking forward) immediately below the 
split-line of the HPC case, was found to be disengaged from the connecting link on the IGV 
actuation ring (Figure 11).  This lever exhibited no distortion or damage but did have a small 
impact mark on its forward edge, which coincided with where the lever arm could come in 
to contact with the HPC case if it was not connected to the connecting link.  There was no 
corresponding mark on the HPC case.  Approximately half of the remaining IGV lever arms 
were bent or distorted and many of the bushings in the IGV actuation ring were absent or 
damaged.

Internal examination of the HPC module
Disassembly of the HPC module showed that all the IGVs had sheared at their outer 
platform.  All 38 HPC stage 1 blades were damaged.  Four blades (Nos 10, 12, 13 and 37) 
had ruptured below the blade platform and one blade (No 9) had separated above the blade 
platform, releasing the remainder of the blade (Figure 12).  Another three blades exhibited 
cracking below the platform.  
The damage to HPC stator vanes and blades downstream of stage 1 was consistent with 
secondary impact damage from the release of the stage 1 blades and the resulting rotor 
imbalance.

Figure 12
HPC module showing missing IGVs and damaged stage 1 blades
Detailed examination of the fracture surfaces of the HPC stage 1 blades which had separated 
below the platform, showed initiation of high-cycle fatigue (HCF) above the pressure surface 
on the concave side of the blade, near the leading edge.  The fatigue had propagated 
downward and through the thickness of the blade.  Beyond the area of HCF, the fracture 
surface was consistent with tensile overload.  Blade 10, which exhibited the greatest area 
of fatigue, was most likely the first blade to be released (Figure 13).  The fracture surface of 
the blade which had failed above the platform was consistent with tensile overload and had 
been heavily smeared, which was indicative of secondary damage.
On the blades which exhibited below-platform cracking, the cracking was consistent with 
the initiation of HCF in the blade dovetail, but the fatigue had not yet propagated to the point 
of tensile overload.
Detailed component examination – IGV hardware
The IGV connecting link exhibited no damage.  Approximately half of the lever arms were 
bent or distorted, including several immediately adjacent to the disconnected lever arm. 
The disconnected lever arm, which was free to rotate exhibited a contact mark, most likely 
from contact with the HPC case.

Known effects of disengaged IGV/VSV lever arm
The engine manufacturer advised that a disengaged, bent or broken IGV or VSV lever arm will 
result in an off-schedule variable vane which does not move in unison with the other vanes.  
This will cause variation in the airflow around the vane, and lead to a once-per-revolution 
(1/rev) excitation of the adjacent blades as they rotate past the vane.  The force of the 
excitation is proportional to the angle of the off-schedule vane.  The excitation creates 
stresses in the blade which are beyond the design limit.  This phenomenon typically results 
in below-platform fracture in the blade dovetail, caused by a fatigue crack which initiates 
on the concave face of the blade and propagates towards the convex face.  The crack 
grows with every loading cycle (aerodynamic excitation) and as it does, the load-carrying 
capability of the blade reduces, until ultimately it fails in tensile overload.
The engine manufacturer determined that the blade fracture surfaces from this event, were 
consistent with its experience of previous events where 1/rev aerodynamic excitation had 
occurred as a result of one or more disengaged, bent or broken IGV/VSV lever arms.
The engine manufacturer is aware of approximately 200 off-schedule VSV findings and/or 
events, of which 22 were attributed to improper engagement of lever arms in the connecting 
links.  Thirteen of those, including this event resulted in HPC blade release.  Of those, 
ESN 697283 had the lowest cycles to failure (220 cycles) and was among those with lowest 
time to failure (513 hours).  The remaining nine occurrences were detected before blade 
release occurred.
The previous thirteen events have shown that the time to blade release is variable and 
can be influenced by the magnitude of the excitation force, the individual blade material 
properties and the nature of the improper engagement of the lever arm.

Other findings during engine disassembly
During the engine examination several non-conformances were noted with components 
which may have been disturbed during the recent engine repair, but these were not 
considered causal or contributory to the engine failure.  Non-conformances were also noted 
with engine components which were not disturbed during the recent repair and it was outside 
the scope of this investigation to determine when these non-conformances had occurred.
Maintenance documentation
CFM56 Engine Shop Manual (ESM) task 72-00-32-430-001 ‘Compressor Front Stator 
Assembly – Installation’ includes the following instructions to verify that the IGV and VSV 
lever arms are correctly installed in the connecting links.
‘…. CAUTION: HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSOR BLADE DAMAGE WILL 
OCCUR IF THE LEVER ARM PINS ARE NOT CORRECTLY ENGAGED 
INTO THE CONNECTING LINKS AND ACTUATION RING BUSHINGS.
(6)  Do a visual inspection to make sure all of the lever arm pins are correctly 
engaged as follows:
(a) 
Verify the lever arm pins are properly installed into each of the 
connecting links.
1 
Place a white stripe across four IGV lever arm pins and 
bushings (2 each side).  Use a temporary marking pen.
2 
Place a white stripe across eight stage 1, 2 and 3 lever arm 
pins and bushings (4 each side).  Use a temporary marking 
pen.
(b) 
Verify that all IGV and stage 1, 2 and 3 lever arm pins are engaged 
around the entire VSV system.’
Information from the engine maintenance facility
Personnel from the engine overhaul facility were interviewed on behalf of the AAIB by the 
Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee.
The mechanic who installed the IGV and VSV connecting links, reported that although 
access was difficult in some places, he did not find any discrepancies with the lever arms 
when performing the task.  Similarly, the certifying engineer who inspected the installation 
of the IGV and VSV connecting links and those involved in other related tasks on the VSV 
actuation system, did not note any discrepancies with the lever arms.  Additionally, no defects 
were identified during the post-maintenance inspections.   The maintenance job card for the 
installation of the IGV and VSV connecting links referenced the relevant ESM task and was 
stamped as having been completed and inspected.  When asked about what circumstances 
might have contributed to the IGV lever arm not being attached to the connecting link, the 
mechanic involved stated that he did not know how this occurred, but that since there are 
several external accessories that needed to be moved for access, it might be possible to

overlook tightening a lever arm.  The certifying engineer indicated his belief that if an IGV 
was not secure, an engine surge or stall would occur during the post-maintenance engine 
run or post maintenance check flight.
ESN 697283 was the first CFM56-5 engine that the engine overhaul facility had worked on, 
but the engineers working on ESN 697283 had undertaken CFM-56-5 training and were 
accustomed to working on CFM56-3 and CFM56-7 engines.  They reported that they did not 
encounter any significant differences or difficulties working the IGV/VSV system.
The engineers reported that there were no issues with workload, overtime or night working 
during the engine repair, as all maintenance tasks were planned to be completed within a 
day shift.  They indicated that they had good access to tools and that the ESM was available 
at every workstation.
Analysis
Flight crew aspects
After the failure of the left engine the flight crew responded correctly by rejecting the takeoff, 
bringing the aircraft to a stop and announcing “attention crew: on station” to the FAs 
and actioning the ECAM checklist.  As the engine failure was secured by the crew actioning 
the ECAM checklist and there were no other causes for concern, the decision to vacate the 
runway under the power of the right engine was appropriate.  
The crew were subsequently surprised to see a cabin door open, a slide deployed and 
passengers walking in front of the aircraft.  The commander then contacted the SFA to ask 
why an evacuation had been initiated.  After this exchange he realised that passengers 
were going towards the right engine, which was still operating.  Had any of them entered 
the right engine’s inlet suction danger area (Figure 1, Area A), it is possible that they could 
have been sucked into the engine.  The right engine was shutdown 2 minutes after the 
commander noticed that Door 1L was open.
Once they had noticed that an evacuation had commenced there was realistically no way 
that the flight crew would have been able to recover the situation.  It may have been prudent 
to action the EMER EVAC checklist to ensure that the aircraft systems were all in as safe 
a state as possible for the passengers to exit the aircraft.  However, given that passengers 
were potentially going to encroach into the right engine’s inlet suction danger area it was 
probably quicker to select the eng master to off.  Had the commander prioritised shutting 
down the engine and thus had a more succinct discussion with the SFA, the right engine 
could have been shut down sooner.
Flight attendant aspects
All evacuations carry risk of passenger injury so flight attendants should not command an 
evacuation unless there is no doubt that it is required.  The operator’s Flight Safety Manual 
listed the circumstances when flight attendants should initiate an evacuation and none of 
these criteria applied.  A combination of factors combined to overwhelm the SFA and cause 
her to command the evacuation over the PA.

OE-LOA 
AAIB-25599
At the front of the aircraft, the noise of the engine failure sounded very loud to the two FAs.  
The SFA was startled by the noise of the engine failure and the movement of the aircraft 
to the side of the runway.  This appears to have caused her to narrow her attention to the 
aircraft sounds so that she did not hear the “attention crew: on station” command.  The 
other FAs all heard it and were not aware that she had not.
Initially it was organised and calm in the cabin at the rear of the aircraft.  The crew members 
there were helped by the calming influence of FA4 who was more experienced.  Also FA3 
and the ACM were recent recruits and may have benefitted from the recency of their training.
Communication between the SFA and FA3 was not effective in either means or content.  The 
crew members’ and passengers’ accounts suggested that communication was attempted 
using a combination of the PA system, the interphone, shouting and hand gestures.  A 
combination of English and German language was used.
The interphone at the FA3 seat was knocked off by the force of the folding seat closing.  
This resulted in the attention-getting chime and lights being inhibited so there was a delay 
between the SFA calling and establishing communication.  The FAs reported that the 
handsets were prone to falling out of the cradle.
It was dark outside, and the cabin lights were dimmed for takeoff.  The lack of light in the 
cabin made it difficult to see what was happening at the rear of the aircraft so communication 
by hand signals was not effective and the SFA could not see that the interphone was stuck.
The communication difficulty meant that the SFA could not establish whether the situation 
was safe at the rear of the aircraft.  The SFA formed the impression that all the other 
flight attendants were scared.  Only one minute and twenty seconds elapsed between the 
“attention crew: on station” command and the ‘evacuate’ command by the SFA.  It would 
have felt like much longer to the flight attendants, especially the SFA who had heard nothing 
from the cockpit and felt under pressure from the passengers.  Altogether this increased her 
anxiety and uncertainty and contributed to her commanding the evacuation.
Any FA could have contacted the cockpit during this time.  The FAs who heard the “attention 
crew: on station” command would have been unlikely to do so because they understood 
the procedure to wait.  The SFA had not heard this command but it did not occur to her to 
contact the pilots.  As well as her emotional state, this may have been partly because her 
interactions with them were so limited under normal circumstances.  The operator did not 
provide training for FAs and pilots designed to increase their interaction and understanding 
of each other’s roles.  All FAs had been trained that the pilots would be busy in an emergency, 
but they had no understanding of the tasks the pilots were doing or how long they would 
take.
Not all passengers heard the evacuation command on the PA.  If the evacuation signal had 
been used the passenger response and the overall evacuation may have been quicker.  
However, this was not available to the FAs and the pilots were unlikely to operate it given 
they had not commanded the evacuation.

The SFA had recently been promoted after a relatively short time as an FA.  During her 
time as FA, there was a period where she did not fly due to the operator’s bankruptcy.  As 
a result, she did not meet the operator’s requirement for promotion in terms of duration of 
operational experience.  Her initial training course as an FA was within a large group which 
may have resulted in aspects not being fully explained or understood by all that attended.  
The pressure to have staff operationally available for flights after the bankruptcy and change 
of operator meant that the subsequent training for SFA was purely theoretical and short in 
comparison to the operator’s more recent practice.  These factors may have meant that the 
SFA was not well prepared for her role in the emergency.
All FA practical training for emergencies involved a practice evacuation.  None of them had 
practiced a return to normal operation.  This may have resulted in a false expectation that 
all emergencies would result in an evacuation.
Overall, it seems that the SFA’s emotional response to the emergency was aggravated by 
her general inexperience and the communication difficulties the FAs encountered.  Despite 
meeting regulatory requirements, there were weaknesses in her training that meant she 
was not well prepared for the situation.  Together this resulted in an overwhelming ‘flight’ 
response in which she felt the need for herself and everyone else in the cabin to escape the 
situation as quickly as possible.  She did not contact the pilots and ended up commanding 
an evacuation. The operator has undertaken to implement a range of improvements to FA 
training and to instruct FAs to attempt to establish communication with the flight deck before 
commanding an evacuation.
The evacuation
Once the evacuation was commenced it was important that it proceeded in as safe and 
efficient a manner as possible to minimise the risk of passenger injury.  In general, the 
evacuation proceeded swiftly, without significant panic or delay.  The event provided an 
opportunity to learn about factors that influence a safe and efficient evacuation.
Many passengers in this evacuation collected their bags and attempted to leave the 
aircraft with them.  At the supervised doors, the FAs removed baggage from them.  At the 
unsupervised overwing exits passengers with bags could exit unchallenged.  Baggage 
brought to the exits created difficulty for the FAs who then needed to remove it and store 
it somewhere which could have created an obstruction.  The carried baggage probably 
slowed the evacuation and had the potential to damage the escape slides or injure other 
passengers on the slides. It was not possible to determine how long the evacuation took 
compared to the CS-25 requirement of 90 seconds.
The safety studies by the NTSB, TSB Canada, EASA and the Royal Aeronautical Society 
show that carried baggage has long been an issue.  Appendix 1 lists many of the evacuation 
events identified in these four studies and provides additional details.  It shows that it is 
extremely common for passengers to carry off bags in evacuations, even when there is a 
clear and immediate threat to life from remaining on board the aircraft.  One of the events 
shows that even trained flight crew are not immune from the compulsion to keep their 
possessions with them.  There were several examples where witnesses reported that 
41

 AAIB Bulletin: 9/2020 
OE-LOA 
AAIB-25599
this passenger behaviour slowed the evacuation or that the evacuation took longer than 
90 seconds.
The Royal Aeronautical Society commented that:
‘This trend appears to be increasing and can only be exacerbated by the 
increasing volume of cabin baggage being permitted by some operators for 
commercial reasons.’  
The Society made a recommendation to consider physical means of preventing passengers 
retrieving their baggage: 
‘Aviation�authorities�should�consider�the�feasibility�of�introducing�a�certification�
requirement�for�a�means�of�remotely�locking,�from�the�flight�deck,�overhead�bins�
in�passenger�cabins�that�do�not�contain�emergency�equipment,�for�taxi,�take-off�
and landing.’
Current mitigations for the issue include passenger briefing and printed instructions on 
the cabin safety card.  However, the motivation for passengers to remain united with their 
baggage is extremely powerful and, in some cases, the danger is not immediately apparent 
to passengers.  These factors may lead passengers to feel it is safe to pause and collect 
baggage and for the evacuation to proceed at a slower pace.  For a high proportion of 
passengers, briefing and instruction by FAs does not overcome this.
The EASA addressed previous Safety Recommendation 2014-005 and published new 
acceptable means of compliance in AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.170 on ‘passenger�briefing’ and 
new guidance material in GM2 CAT.OP.MPA.170, (f)(5)(vi) ‘Passenger� briefing� -� safety�
briefing�material’ almost two years before this accident. The operator was compliant with 
the new material but, despite these improvements, the instructions about baggage still did 
not influence this behaviour for a high percentage of passengers.
The evidence from this accident, in combination with the collated evidence from previous 
cases shows that, even despite recent improvements, it remains the case that passenger 
briefing, safety cards and FA instructions are insufficient to stop passengers retrieving cabin 
baggage during an evacuation.  This hazard will still exist in future emergencies unless 
additional measures are taken to either reduce the impact of that behaviour on the safety 
and speed of an evacuation or to prevent passengers evacuating with baggage.  Therefore, 
the following Safety Recommendation is made:
Safety Recommendation 2020-018
It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency commission 
research to determine how to prevent passengers from obstructing aircraft 
evacuations by retrieving carry-on baggage.

This incident has shown once again that, during an emergency evacuation, a proportion 
of passengers will attempt to leave the aircraft with their carry-on baggage slowing the 
evacuation process.  The emergency evacuation demonstrations conducted to show 
compliance with CS-25 do not include a realistic simulation of this aspect of passenger 
behaviour which will slow down the evacuation and increase the risk of injury.  Therefore, 
the following Safety Recommendation is made:
Safety Recommendation 2020-019
It is recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency consider 
including a more realistic simulation of passenger behaviour in regard to carry-on 
baggage in the test criteria and procedures for the emergency demonstration 
in CS-25.
Engine failure
The left engine experienced a contained failure as a result of the release of several HPC 
stage 1 blades.  The blade failures were caused by crack progression due to HCF with final 
failure due to tensile overload.  Several other blades also exhibited fatigue initiation in the 
blade dovetail.  The fatigue failures on the liberated blade fracture surfaces were consistent 
with failure due to a known aerodynamic excitation phenomenon which results from an 
off-schedule IGV/VSV condition and creates stresses in the blade which are beyond the 
design limit.  One IGV lever arm was found disconnected from the connecting link on the 
IGV actuating ring and would have provided the stimulus for the aerodynamic excitation.     
In comparison with other blade liberation events arising from improper engagement of IGV/
VSV lever arms with the connecting link, ESN 697283 demonstrated a low time to failure.  
The magnitude of the excitation force, and therefore the time to failure, depends on the 
extent to which the affected vane is off-schedule (the angle between it and the other vanes).  
The fact that the lever arm was fully disengaged from the connecting link and the vane was 
therefore free to move, may have influenced the comparatively low time to failure.
The release of the HPC stage 1 blades resulted in separation of all the IGVs and the forces 
experienced by the vanes would have been transmitted through the lever arms and into the 
actuation ring.  The absence of damage on the disconnected lever arm indicates that it was 
disconnected from the connecting link prior to, and not as a result of, the engine failure.
The IGV actuation ring connecting links were removed and reassembled during the 
recent engine repair, and it is probable that mis-assembly of the lever arm occurred at this 
time.  The relevant ESM task contains instructions for a visual inspection to verify proper 
installation of the lever arms.  But the mis-assembly was not identified by maintenance staff 
during installation of the IGV connecting link, visual inspection, or during other maintenance 
conducted in the immediate vicinity of the lever arm.
As reassembly of the engine progressed, it is unlikely that the disconnected IGV lever arm 
could have been easily detected as it would have been obscured by the external hoses, 
pipes and brackets.  It is also highly unlikely that post-maintenance engine-runs would have 
detected an improperly assembled IGV lever arm.

OE-LOA 
AAIB-25599
The time elapsed between the engine repair and the subsequent investigation and the 
absence of anything particularly memorable about the installation of the connecting links, 
meant that there was limited information available regarding the factors which may have 
contributed to the IGV lever arm mis-assembly.
The engine manufacturer commented that it considered incomplete installation of 
components as ‘‘a common skill-based error’’.  Additional training or revisions to maintenance 
documentation have typically been shown to be ineffective in preventing improper 
component installation.  In general, such occurrences can only be reliably prevented by 
design solutions, or an error-tolerant design from the outset.
The engine manufacturer has considered these aspects and determined that the addition 
of further instructions in the ESM is not likely to be an effective mitigation.  Mitigating or 
eliminating the possibility of an improperly assembled IGV/VSV lever would require an 
engine redesign which it does not consider feasible based on the low rate of occurrence. 
It further indicated that the limited space, concentration of moving parts and engine 
temperatures in the vicinity of the IGV/VSV actuation rings would preclude the installation 
of a placard to highlight the correct assembly of the IGV/VSV connecting links.
The engine manufacturer presented on the subject of improper IGV/VSV lever arm assembly 
and its consequences at an All Operators Conference in June 2019 and published an article 
in its monthly publication ‘Fleet Highlites’, available to all CFM operators and approved 
overhaul facilities, in January of 2020.  It also intends to highlight this subject during calls 
with its field service representatives for onward dissemination to operators and overhaul 
facilities.
There is currently no means, other than visual inspection, to detect improper lever arm 
assembly.  The engine manufacturer has recently implemented an HPC performance 
analytic tool that is designed to detect shifts in HPC efficiency.  Relevant alerts from the 
analytic tool are notified to operators.  While there is not currently enough experience with 
the analytic tool to determine if the effects of a mis-assembled lever arm could manifest as 
a detectable shift in engine performance, the engine manufacturer intends to evaluate this 
possibility as experience with the tool increases.
CVR
Discussions between the flight crew and FAs were captured on the CVR which aided the 
investigation.  However, the PA announcements were not recorded which would have 
provided useful information for this investigation.  The operator’s pre-flight checklist required 
ACP selections to ensure the PA was recorded.  It was not established why the CVR did not 
record the PA audio.
Conclusions
The left engine experienced a contained engine failure.  All the damage found in the engine 
was consistent with the release of one or more high-pressure compressor stage 1 blades 
as a result of high-cycle fatigue arising from aerodynamic excitation of the blades.  A 
single inlet guide vane lever arm, which had been improperly assembled in the connecting

link on the inlet guide vane actuation ring, was identified as the source of the stimulus that 
resulted in the blade release.
As a result of the engine failure and subsequent rejected takeoff, the Senior Flight 
Attendant commanded an emergency evacuation that was not necessary in the 
circumstances.  This was probably the result of a combination of factors that heightened 
her emotional response to the event and affected her decision making.  The factors 
included inexperience as a flight attendant, weaknesses in her training and communication 
difficulties during the event.
As a result of the flight crew not being consulted before the evacuation was commenced, 
the right engine remained running for the first few minutes of the evacuation.  This led to 
an increased risk of serious injury to those passengers that evacuated on the right side 
of the aircraft.  Indeed, several passengers sustained minor injuries having been blown 
over by the exhaust.
During the evacuation several passengers hindered the evacuation by taking their cabin 
baggage with them.  While some were removed by the flight attendants at the supervised 
exits, this was not possible at the overwing exits. Two Safety Recommendations are made 
regarding passengers evacuating with carry-on baggage.
Safety actions
As a result of this event the operator has stated that several safety actions have been or will 
be completed, including:
Procedures
● 
The operator sent a Memo, on 19 May 2020, to all its Airbus pilots instructing 
them to ensure the PA recept is selected on an Audio Control Panel, thus 
ensuring the CVR records any PA announcements.
● 
The operator’s Flight Safety Manual will be amended to instruct the Flight 
Attendants to attempt to establish communications with the flight crew to 
check that an evacuation is safe and necessary before commanding it 
independently.
Training
The operator has taken the following safety actions in relation to its flight 
attendant training.  The operator has:
● 
Augmented the team responsible for training with the addition of a deputy 
manager of flight attendant training.
● 
Introduced a maximum limit of 25 trainees in initial flight attendant training 
courses.  After approval from the operator’s competent authority, it was 
subsequently increased to 30 in April 2020.

● 
Added practical training in the CEET to the senior flight attendant course 
as standard.  Practical training has also been incorporated in their annual 
recurrent training.
● 
Improved variety of training scenarios in the CEET, including scenarios that 
result in a return to normal operations rather than an evacuation.
● 
Improved the syllabus of flight attendant training to include the performance 
effects of startle, an improved 30-second review15 technique and enhanced 
communication training.
● 
Produced a video training aid that will introduce flight attendants to the 
actions of the flight crew after a rejected takeoff. 
● 
Extended the aeroplane familiarisation phase during initial training with 
additional familiarisation flights.
Crew composition
● 
The operator has introduced a requirement in the Operations Manual 
regarding flight attendant team composition.  A minimum of two experienced 
flight attendants shall be part of the operating crew’s complement.  This is 
50% of the operating crew members, as their A320s are operated with four 
flight attendants.
The engine manufacturer has stated the following safety actions have or will be taken:
● 
Provided a presentation on the subject of improper IGV/VSV lever arm 
assembly and its consequences at an All Operators Conference in 
June 2019 and published an article in its monthly publication ‘Fleet Highlites’ 
in January 2020.
● 
Highlight the issue of improper IGV/VSV lever arm assembly during calls 
with its field service representatives for onward dissemination to operators 
and overhaul facilities.
● 
Evaluate the use of a HPC performance analytic tool to determine if the 
effects of a mis-assembled lever arm could be identified from a detectable 
shift in engine performance.

Runway departure after a bird strike to 
the nosewheel.  The report stated ‘A lot of 
passengers took baggage and personal 
items with them despite of the commands 
and instructions of the cabin attendants. 
This somewhat delayed the evacuation’.  
Safety cards did not contain an instruction 
to leave baggage behind in an emergency 
and no specific pre-flight instructions 
were provided to that effect.  Identified in 
the EASA study as taking longer than 90 
seconds to complete the evacuation.
