Narrative:
Ural Airlines Flight 178, an Airbus A321-211, registration VQ-BOZ, was substantially damaged when it force landed to a
cornfield shortly after takeoff due to a dual bird strike and engine failure. Ten passengers were injured.
The aircraft with 226 passengers and 7 crew, was in the initial climb through 750 feet out of Zkukovsky's runway 12 when
the aircraft flew through a flock of seagulls and ingested birds into both engines (CFM56). Both engines lost power forcing
the crew to stop the climb at 750 feet and land the aircraft in a corn field about 2-3nm past the runway with gear retracted.
The occupants of the aircraft evacuated via slides.
