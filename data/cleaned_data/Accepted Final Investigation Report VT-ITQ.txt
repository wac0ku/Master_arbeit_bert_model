were confined to core Engine  2 only 113 Medical and Pathological Information The crew had undergone preflight medical including BA Breath Analyzer Test as per requirements The test result was negative 114 Fire There was no fire 115 Survival Aspects The Incident was survivable 116 Test and Research 1161 Tear Down Reports from Pratt  Whitney As per agreement between Ms Indigo and OEM the damaged engine was replaced with a serviceable engine The damaged RH engine was sent to OEM after the incident The ut There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades preceding 12 this incident The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue which had a developed corrective action in place No Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM on the incident Engine ESN P770881 During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair LPT 3 Blades were found fractured and impact damage was noted in the LPT and TEC The LPT shaft and LPT2 disk showed indications of rotor rubabnormal deflection The TIC piston seals showed light wear with no missing material Hardware affected by impact damage was repaired or replaced as required A new LPT3 rotor was installed as per SB 72000111 The engine had also reportedly experienced EGT overtemperature onwing The HPT2 snap ring HPT1 and HPT2 blades and forward ID TIC piston seal were routed for overtemperature analysis The analysis result showed these items did not experience overtemperature 1162 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories Bengaluru AAIB India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187 P770530 and P770516 which suffered similar LPT 3rd stage blade failure during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories NAL Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB VTITQ was fitted with ESN P770881 at the time of incident Given the similar nature of failure and findings of shop inspection it is presumed that failure on ESN P770881 was similar to failure on engines involved in other LPT 3rd stage turbine failure incidents including ESN P770187 P770530 and P770516 for which failure analysis was carried out at NAL Bengaluru Following are the salient observations made in the failure analysis report provided by NAL Bengaluru  Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at varying heights from the blade root platform Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge TE of the available part of the airfoil Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions 13 Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation In the fractured blades the fracture process in gammaphase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar separation in lamellar colonies Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction MoC showed that stage 3 LPT blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide TiAl an intermetallic material The MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52 Titanium Ti  43 Aluminium Al 4 Nobium Nb and 1 Molybdenum Mo The material did not have any metallurgical abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades TiAlbase intermetallic materials are in general brittle in nature having low fracture toughness Although the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with engineered microstructure the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance properties compared to the conventional Nickel Nibase superalloy that is generally used in this section of gas turbine engines The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae and isolated single phase gamma grains Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation the crack propagates instantaneously leading to fracture 117 Organizational and Management Information The aircraft VTITQ is operated by Ms Indigo which is an Indian registered Scheduled airline and one of the launch customers for the Airbus A320 NEO aircraft fitted with PW1127G JM engines It operates scheduled flights to both domestic and international sectors It has got a fleet of Airbus A320A321 and

corresponding to type of failure is as below  Type of Failure Number of Serious Incidents  3 bearing seal failure 01 LPT failure 15 N2 Vibration 01 MGB IDGLSOP gear failure 01 As per the above table it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents corresponds to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight As per agreement between Ms Indigo and OEM the damaged engines were replaced by serviceable engines All engines involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were quarantined after the occurrence and sent to OEM Pratt  Whitney facility in USA and Germany for repair Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical investigation as the events were similar to various prior occurrences and considered to be a known issue 16 The Shop Visit report of all these Engine was shared with AAIB through Accredited Representative of NTSB 1182 Service Bulletin 72000111  Disk LPT 3rd Stage and Blade LPT 3rd Stage and ShroudSegment Ring 3rd Stage  Introduction of a New LPT 3rd Stage Blade which is more ter Issue 2 was issued on 18th October 2019 and finally Issue 3 was issued on 28th May 2020 ge blade material The SB required that the LPT 3rd stage disk blades locking plates and shroud segments be replaced by the new set made of different material 1183 GuidelinesDeadline given  action taken by DGCA DGCA issued a deadline to Ms Indigo stating that each A320 NEO aircraft with PW1127GJM engine where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH must have at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith Further it stated that all the A320 NEO aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by 31st January 2020 On 25th November 2019 DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified LPT engines It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported Thereafter DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of Indigo However it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue to remain in force DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of replacement of unmodified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020 Later on 27th 17 May 2020 DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127GJM engines 280 engines of Indigo had complied with SB 72000111 ie all its NEO fleet 140 aircraft were installed with LPT modified engines 119 Useful or Effective Investigation Techniques Nil 2 ANALYSIS 21 General Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident The Aircraft held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of departure Airworthiness Directives  Service Bulletins were complied with Transit Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all higher and specified in Maintenance Programme 22 Circumstances Leading to the Incident VTITQ was equipped with PW1127GJM engine Sr No 770881 This engine was fitted with premodified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and impact tolerance The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing Flight Level 115 A loud bang was heard by the crew Subsequently ENG 2 STALL ECAM This was followed by ENG 2 EGT OVERLIMIT and ENG 2 HGH VIB on ECAM The crew followed ECAM actions and QRHFCOM checklist for Engine Stall and Engine Vibration The Engine parameters ie N1 and N2 vibrations was at 7 and 10 respectively EGT was noticed to be increasing past 1000oC As the Engine parameters were abnormal the crew decided to divert back to Lucknow No Emergency was declared by the crew After obtaining necessary clearances from ATC Lucknow the aircraft landed safely at Lucknow During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged Incident was one amongst series 18 of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical Investigation into this case 23 LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action Based on the analysis by NAL Bengaluru to study Material of Construction MoC it was determined that the premodified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gammabased Titanium Aluminide TiAl which is in general brittle in nature having low fracture toughness Although the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with engineered microstructure the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance properties It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL Bengaluru that LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187 770530 and 770516 had fractured instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation the crack propagated instantaneously leading to fracture It is therefore evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades could not withstand possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously This led to engine high vibration and EGT overlimit Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified engines the airlines complied with SB 72000111 and all its A320 NEO fleet 140 aircraft were installed with LPT modified engines 3 CONCLUSION 31 Findings 1 The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness Certificate of Registration and the Certificate of Flight Release before operating the incident flight 2 Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight 3 There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft 4 During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine ie inlet area and exhaust area of Engine  2 Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged
