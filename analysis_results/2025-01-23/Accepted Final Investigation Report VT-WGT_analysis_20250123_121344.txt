1.18.2 Rectification Action carried out for MGB IDG/LSOP gear failure.
Engine Sr No. 770792 was inducted at OEM facility for disassembly, inspection and
repair. The IDG gear shaft was found fractured with secondary damage throughout the Main
Gearbox. The Main Gearbox was found with the MOP/IDG Gear fractured. The Main Gearbox
was rebuilt to incorporate SB 72-00-0129 in order to address this failure mode.
In Preliminary Observation Report of the occurrence, data of similar occurrences worldwide
since October 2018 till the date of occurrence was analyzed and is given below: -
- There were 08 IFSD events/ 02 on-ground events.
- Issue presents as Low Oil Pressure ECAM warning.
- All 08 IFSD events were confirmed to have fractures of the Main Oil Pump (MOP).
Figure 5 : Fractured MOP/IDG Gear

Seite 21:
In the report, P&W came up with a corrective action plan to eliminate reoccurrence of such
types of failure in future. The said report also mentioned that the fractured MOP/IDG Gear is consistent
with other AGB events. The report said that the root cause investigation has involved both rig and
engine testing. This revealed that crack initiation in the MOP/IDG gear has been linked to vibratory
excitation of MOP/IDG gear under certain engine operating conditions. Following Corrective Action
Plan, was given to reduce event frequency: -
- Engine Software (FCS 5.0) with keep-out zones at certain N2 speeds.
- On-wing retrofit with redesigned MOP/IDG gear to avoid vibratory response.

terminating action for the problem.
Airbus SB 73- Engine Fuel and Control - FADEC System - Introduce FCS5.0
was also introduced. The purpose of this Service Bulletin is to
introduce a new FADEC standard (STD) FCS5.0 (EEC and PHMU) on PW1100G-JM engines.
The FCS5.0 software addresses specific items and provides additional software improvements
on EEC and PHMU with respect to overall software robustness.
M/s Go Air has carried out the task as per the above said SBs and as on date, all their
serviceable PW1127G-JM engines are complied with both SBs. No similar occurrence has
been reported in India since the compliance of these SB issued by Pratt & Whitney and Airbus.

2 ANALYSIS
2.1 General
Both operating crew were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of
departure. Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit
Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all
guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme were carried out as and when due.
2.2 Circumstances Leading to the Incident
EC ALTERNATOR,
(Engine # 1 Low Oil Pressure) also triggered on ECAM. The engine oil pressure was found
reducing below 100 and was reduced to 2 within 05 seconds. The Engine # 1 power was
crew carried out ECAM actions and subsequently carried out commanded IFSD of Engine # 1.
As the Engine parameters were abnormal and the engine # 1 was Shut Down, the crew
Varanasi instructed aircraft to descend to lower level (FL240). The aircraft was then changed
over to ATC, Lucknow. After obtaining necessary clearances from ATC, Lucknow the aircraft
landed uneventfully with single engine at Lucknow.
Oil quantity of ENG # 1 was found to be 2 quarts which was 20 quarts at the beginning
of flight. The consumption during the sector was abnormal. Oil traces were found on exhaust
nozzle, tail cone, drain mast and TR cowl area underneath drain mast.
Metal particles were observed on ENG # 1 MGB chip collector. The involved engine
(ENG # 1) was removed from the aircraft for further detailed examination and aircraft released
for further flight operations.
During Disassembly and Inspection of the engine carried out by OEM, it was observed
that the IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly fractured during engine operation. It was
16

Seite 23:
opined by the OEM that the resonance response of some IDG oil pump drive gear shaft
assemblies to certain engine operating conditions can result in a high cycle fatigue fracture.
This fracture of IDG oil pump drive gear shaft assembly and consequent damages to
other MGB components like PMA, Starter Drive, Deoiler, Hydraulic pump etc. led to improper
scavenging and insufficient air sealing. This resulted in various ECAM fault including Engine
Oil low pressure and subsequently to engine failure and IFSD (Commanded).
2.3 Preventive Actions taken by OEM & Operator
It was observed that the failure of MOP/IDG gear was because of its resonance
response to certain engine operating conditions which resulted in a high cycle fatigue fracture.
The OEM came up with an immediate as well as long-term corrective action plan to arrest such
failing. To eliminate the re-occurrence of IFSD events and obviate fracture of MOP/IDG gear fracture,
