SYNOPSIS
On 03rd January 2019, M/s Indigo Airbus A320-271 (NEO) aircraft VT-ITW, while
operating a scheduled flight from Chennai to Kolkata was involved in an Air Turn Back due to
Engine Stall during climb. The aircraft was under the command of an ATPL holder with a co-
pilot also an ATPL holder. There were 172 passengers on board the aircraft including 04
cabin crew members.
The aircraft took off from Chennai. While climbing passing Flight Level 210, a loud
bang was heard by the crew and subsequently, ENG 2 STALL ECAM.
This was followed by ENG 2 HGH VIB and ENG 2 EGT OVERLIMIT on ECAM. The Engine
parameters i.e., N1 and N2 vibrations was at 10 and 8 respectively and the EGT was noticed
to be increasing past 900oC. As the Engine parameters were abnormal, the crew decided to
divert back to Chennai. The aircraft landed safely at Chennai. During post flight inspection of
the engine inlet area and exhaust area, all blades of LPT 3rd stage were found damaged.
The occurrence was classified as a Serious Incident and an investigation to investigate
into the probable cause(s) of the serious incident, was instituted under Rule 11 (1) of Aircraft

1.16 Test and Research
1.16.1 Tear Down Reports from Pratt & Whitney
As per agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engine was replaced
with a serviceable engine. The damaged RH engine was sent to OEM after the incident. The
, Inspection and repair was
carried out. There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage
blades preceding this incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known
issue, which had a developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was
carried out by the OEM on the incident Engine (ESN P770219).
During Disassembly, Inspection and subsequent repair, LPT 3 Blades were found
fractured and impact damage was noted in the LPT and TEC. Hardware affected by impact
damage was repaired or replaced as required. A new LPT3 rotor was installed as per SB 72-
00-0111.
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and P770516
which suffered similar LPT 3rd stage blade failure during different flights, tested at National
Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. NAL
carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB.
VT-ITW was fitted with ESN P770219 at the time of incident. Given the similar nature
of failure and findings of shop inspection, it is presumed that failure on ESN P770219 was
similar to failure on engines involved in other LPT 3rd stage turbine failure incidents including
ESN P770187, P770530 and P770516 for which failure analysis was carried out at NAL,
Bengaluru. Following are the salient observations made in the failure analysis report provided
by NAL, Bengaluru: -
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at
varying heights from the blade root platform.
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the
available part of the airfoil.
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated
chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.
13

Seite 20:
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously
in a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive
failure such as fatigue.
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the
blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades,
the fracture process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar separation
in lamellar colonies.
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3 LPT
blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material. The
MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium (Al),
4% Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any metallurgical
abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades.
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl
alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance
properties compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used in
this section of gas turbine engines.
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae
and isolated single phase gamma grains.
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed
that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack
propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.
1.17 Organizational and Management Information

1.18 Additional Information
1.18.1 Typical Snags Reported in PW1127G-JM Engines
Since the induction of PW1127G-JM engines in India in the year 2016, there have been
a number of snags reported on aircraft fitted with these engines. Most of the snags were
repetitive in nature. In order to prevent reoccurrence of such failures, Pratt & Whitney came
up with some rectification actions/modifications for each snag.
The following table depicts the Typical Snags and Rectification Action/Modification
carried out by Pratt & Whitney along with the status of action taken by M/s Indigo as of 17th
Nov 2020: -

As per the above table, it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents
corresponds to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight. As per
agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engines were replaced by serviceable
engines.
All engines involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were quarantined after
the occurrence and sent to OEM (Pratt & Whitney) facility in USA and Germany for repair.
Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical investigation as the

The reason for issue of this SB w
new LPT 3rd stage blade made of a different material which is more resistant to impact
The SB required that the LPT 3rd stage disk, blades, locking plates, and shroud
segments be replaced by the new set made of different material.
1.18.3 Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA.
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must have
at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the A320 NEO
aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by
31st January 2020.
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which
has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) engines.
It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported.
Thereafter, DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th
November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding
an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet
of Indigo. However, it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will
continue to remain in force.
17

Seite 24:
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th
May 2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st
August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic.
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had
complied with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT
modified engines.
1.19 Useful or Effective Investigation Techniques
Nil
2 ANALYSIS
2.1 General
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of
departure. Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit
Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all
guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme.
2.2 Circumstances Leading to the Incident
VT-ITW was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. P770219. This engine was
fitted with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and
impact tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing
Flight Level 210. A loud bang was heard by the crew. Subsequently, ENG 2 STALL
was triggered on ECAM. This was followed by ENG 2 HGH VIB and ENG 2 EGT
OVERLIMIT on ECAM. The Engine parameters i.e., N1 and N2 vibrations were at 10 and 8
respectively and the EGT was noticed to be increasing past 900oC. Owing to abnormal engine
parameters, the crew decided to divert back to Chennai. The crew carried out ECAM
procedures/Checklists for engine stall. No Emergency was declared by the crew. After
obtaining necessary clearances from ATC, Chennai, the aircraft landed safely at Chennai.
18

Seite 25:
During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine,
Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged. Incident was one amongst
series of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical Investigation
into this case.
2.3 LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action.
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it
was determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based Titanium
Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture toughness.
Although, the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys
with engineered microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance
properties. It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL, Bengaluru that
LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had fractured
instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any signatures
of progressive failure such as fatigue.
The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack
growth resistance and after initiation, the crack propagated instantaneously leading to
fracture. It is, therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades
could not withstand possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured
instantaneously. This led to engine high vibration and EGT overlimit.
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft)
were installed with LPT modified engines.
3 CONCLUSION
3.1 Findings
1. The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness, Certificate of Registration and the Certificate
of Flight Release before operating the incident flight.
2. Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight.
3. There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft.
