this incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue, which had
a developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM
on the incident Engine (ESN P770881).
During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair, LPT 3 Blades were found
fractured and impact damage was noted in the LPT and TEC. The LPT shaft and LPT2 disk
showed indications of rotor rub/abnormal deflection. The TIC piston seals showed light wear
with no missing material. Hardware affected by impact damage was repaired or replaced as
required. A new LPT3 rotor was installed as per SB 72-00-0111.
The engine had also reportedly experienced EGT overtemperature on-wing. The HPT2
snap ring, HPT1 and HPT2 blades, and forward ID TIC piston seal were routed for
overtemperature analysis. The analysis result showed these items did not experience
overtemperature.
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and P770516
which suffered similar LPT 3rd stage blade failure during different flights, tested at National
Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. NAL
carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB.
VT-ITQ was fitted with ESN P770881 at the time of incident. Given the similar nature of
failure and findings of shop inspection, it is presumed that failure on ESN P770881 was similar
to failure on engines involved in other LPT 3rd stage turbine failure incidents including ESN
P770187, P770530 and P770516 for which failure analysis was carried out at NAL, Bengaluru.
Following are the salient observations made in the failure analysis report provided by NAL,
Bengaluru: -
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at
varying heights from the blade root platform.
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the
available part of the airfoil.
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated
chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.
12

Seite 19:
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously
in a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive
failure such as fatigue.
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the blades
was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades, the
fracture process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar separation in
lamellar colonies.
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3 LPT
blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material. The
MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium (Al),
4% Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any metallurgical
abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades.
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl
alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance
properties compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used in
this section of gas turbine engines.
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae
and isolated single phase gamma grains.
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed
that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack
propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.
1.17 Organizational and Management Information

1.18 Additional Information
1.18.1 Typical Snags Reported in PW1127G-JM Engines
Since the induction of PW1127G-JM engines in India in the year 2016, there have been
a number of snags reported on aircraft fitted with these engines. Most of the snags were
repetitive in nature. In order to prevent reoccurrence of such failures, Pratt & Whitney came
up with some rectification actions/modifications for each snag.
The following table depicts the Typical Snags and Rectification Action/Modification
carried out by Pratt & Whitney along with the status of action taken by M/s Indigo as of 17th
Nov 2020: -

As per the above table, it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents
corresponds to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight. As per
agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engines were replaced by serviceable
engines. All engines involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were quarantined
after the occurrence and sent to OEM (Pratt & Whitney) facility in USA and Germany for repair.
Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical investigation
as the events were similar to various prior occurrences and considered to be a known issue.

The SB required that the LPT 3rd stage disk, blades, locking plates, and shroud
segments be replaced by the new set made of different material.
1.18.3 Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA.
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must have
at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the A320 NEO
aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by
31st January 2020.
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which has
been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) engines. It
was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported.
Thereafter, DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th
November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding
an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of
Indigo. However, it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue
to remain in force.
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th
16

Seite 23:
May 2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st
August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic.
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had complied
with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT modified
engines.
1.19 Useful or Effective Investigation Techniques
Nil
2 ANALYSIS
2.1 General
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of departure.
Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit Inspections
were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all higher
and specified in Maintenance Programme.
2.2 Circumstances Leading to the Incident
VT-ITQ was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. 770881. This engine was fitted
with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and impact
tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing Flight Level
115. A loud bang was heard by the crew. Subsequently, ENG 2 STALL
ECAM. This was followed by ENG 2 EGT OVERLIMIT and ENG 2 HGH VIB on ECAM. The
crew followed ECAM actions and QRH/FCOM checklist for Engine Stall and Engine Vibration.
The Engine parameters i.e., N1 and N2 vibrations was at 7 and 10 respectively. EGT was
noticed to be increasing past 1000oC. As the Engine parameters were abnormal, the crew
decided to divert back to Lucknow. No Emergency was declared by the crew. After obtaining
necessary clearances from ATC, Lucknow, the aircraft landed safely at Lucknow.
During post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine,
Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were found damaged. Incident was one amongst series
17

Seite 24:
of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did not carry out Technical Investigation into
this case.
2.3 LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action.
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it was
determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based Titanium
Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture toughness. Although,
the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys with
engineered microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance properties. It
was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL, Bengaluru that LPT 3rd stage
blades of the Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had fractured instantaneously in a
brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive failure
such as fatigue.
The fatigue test further confirmed that the material does not have enough crack growth
resistance and after initiation, the crack propagated instantaneously leading to fracture. It is,
therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3 blades failed in flight as these blades could not
withstand possible impact from material liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously.
This led to engine high vibration and EGT overlimit.
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft)
were installed with LPT modified engines.
3 CONCLUSION
3.1 Findings
1. The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness, Certificate of Registration and the Certificate
of Flight Release before operating the incident flight.
2. Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight.
3. There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft.
4. During post flight inspection, while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine,
i.e., inlet area and exhaust area of Engine # 2, Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades were
found damaged.
