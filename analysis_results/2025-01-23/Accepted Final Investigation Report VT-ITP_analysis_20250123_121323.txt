SYNOPSIS
On 29th June 2019, M/s Indigo Airbus A320-271 NEO aircraft VT-ITP, while operating
a scheduled flight from Dehradun to Bengaluru diverted to Delhi due to high engine vibration
& EGT overlimit during climb. The aircraft was under the command of an ATPL holder with
another ATPL holder as co-pilot. There were 186 passengers on board the aircraft including
04 cabin crew members.
The aircraft took-off from Dehradun and flight was uneventful till climbing pass 12000
feet altitude when a loud bang was heard by the crew
warning triggered on ECAM. The Engine parameters i.e. N1
vibrations was at 10 and N2 vibrations was at 7 and the EGT was noticed to be increasing
past 1000oC. The Engine # 1 power was gradually brought back to Idle. The flight was
levelled off at FL140. The crew carried out ECAM and QRH procedures. As the Engine
parameters were abnormal, the crew decided to divert to Delhi. The aircraft was then diverted
to Delhi. The aircraft landed safely at Delhi. On visual inspection of the engine inlet area and
exhaust area, all blades of Low-Pressure Turbine 3rd stage were found damaged.
The occurrence was classified as a Serious Incident and an investigation to investigate
into the probable cause(s) was instituted under Rule 11 (1) of Aircraft (Investigation of
Accidents and Incidents), Rules 2017.

1.15 Survival Aspects
The Incident was survivable.
1.16 Test and Research
1.16.1 Tear Down Reports from Pratt & Whitney
As per agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engine was replaced
with a serviceable engine. The damaged LH engine was sent to OEM after the incident. The
, Engine Disassembly and Inspection was carried
out. There were several similar occurrences involving the failure of LPT 3rd stage blades
preceding this incident. The LPT 3rd stage blade failure was considered to be a known issue,
which had a developed corrective action in place. No Technical Investigation was carried out
by the OEM on the Engine ESN P770516.
During Disassembly and Inspection and subsequent repair, LPT Stage 3 and 1 were
replaced with new as per the Shop Report made available by the OEM. TEC was replaced
with new. The HPT and Combustor were upgraded to Block C configuration. HPC Rear Hub
and Stage 8 IBR were replaced. The main gearbox was modified and EEC/PHMU software
were upgraded as per applicable SBs.
1.16.2 Failure Analysis Report from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bengaluru
AAIB, India got the fractured blades from Engine ESN P770187, P770530 and
P770516 which had failed during different flights tested at National Aerospace Laboratories
(NAL), Bengaluru to carry out Failure Analysis on these blades. ESN P770516 was fitted on
VT-ITP at the time of incident.
NAL carried out failure analysis of these blades and submitted a report to AAIB.
Following are the salient observations made in the failure report: -
Examination revealed that all 78 LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured in the airfoil at
varying heights from the blade root platform.
Impact damages were found present predominantly along trailing edge (TE) of the
available part of the airfoil.
Fracture surfaces of the blades showed a flat appearance with vaguely delineated
chevron marks emanating from the crack origins in many occasions.
11

Seite 18:
Fractography study confirmed that LPT 3rd stage blades had fractured instantaneously
in a brittle manner. None of the blades showed presence of any signatures of progressive
failure such as fatigue.
Scanning electron fractography study confirmed that the crack propagation in the
blades was by mixed mode of cleavage and interlamellar separation. In the fractured blades,
the fracture process in gamma-phase was by cleavage while it was by interlamellar
separation in lamellar colonies.
Metallurgical evaluation of the Material of Construction (MoC) showed that stage 3
LPT blades were made of a Gamma base Titanium Aluminide (TiAl), an intermetallic material.
The MoC of the blades has the nominal composition of 52% Titanium (Ti) , 43% Aluminium
(Al), 4% Nobium (Nb) and 1% Molybdenum (Mo). The material did not have any metallurgical
abnormalities that could be responsible for failure of the LPT blades.
TiAl-base intermetallic materials are, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture
toughness. Although, the alloy used for stage III LPT blades is an improved version of TiAl
alloys with engineered microstructure, the material still lacks adequate damage tolerance
properties compared to the conventional Nickel (Ni)-base superalloy that is generally used in
this section of gas turbine engines.
The MoC possessed a duplex microstructure consisting of mostly colonies of lamellae
and isolated single phase gamma grains.
Fatigue test conducted in this laboratory on the MoC of LPT 3rd stage blades showed
that the material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack
propagates instantaneously leading to fracture.

1.18 Additional Information
1.18.1 Typical Snags Reported in PW1127G-JM Engines
Since the induction of PW1127G-JM engines in India in the year 2016, there have
been a number of snags reported on aircraft fitted with these engines. Most of the snags were
repetitive in nature. In order to prevent reoccurrence of such failures, Pratt & Whitney came
up with some rectification actions/modifications for each snag.

As per the above table, it can be seen that majority of these serious incidents
corresponds to LPT failure wherein the Blades of 3rd Stage of LPT failed in flight. As per
agreement between M/s Indigo and OEM, the damaged engines were replaced by
serviceable engines. All engines involved in the 18 serious incidents discussed above were
quarantined after the occurrence and sent to OEM (Pratt & Whitney) facility in USA and
Germany for repair. Pratt and Whitney did not subject any of these engines to any technical
investigation as the events were similar to various prior occurrences and considered to be a
known issue. The Disassembly and Tear down report of all these Engine was shared with
AAIB through Accredited Representative of NTSB.

The SB required that the LPT 3rd stage disk, blades, locking plates, and shroud
segments be replaced by the new set made of different material.
1.18.3 Guidelines/Deadline given & action taken by DGCA.
DGCA issued a deadline (to M/s Indigo) stating that, each A320 NEO aircraft with
PW1127G-JM engine (where both engines of which has done more than 2900 FH) must have
at least one LPT modified engine installed forthwith. Further, it stated that, all the A320 NEO
aircraft fitted with Pratt and Whitney engines must have LPT modified for both its engines by
31st January 2020.
On 25th November 2019, DGCA issued an order stating that the new aircraft which
has been inducted will slip into the role of one existing aircraft with unmodified (LPT) engines.
It was also stated that no leased engines without modified LPT 3rd stage shall be imported.
Thereafter, DGCA on 19th December 2019 issued an order stating that the order dated 25th
November 2019 and 16th December 2019 will be kept in abeyance to the extent of grounding
an existing aircraft with both unmodified engines upon induction of new aircraft in the fleet of
Indigo. However, it said all other advisories issued by DGCA regarding the same will continue
to remain in force.
DGCA issued order dated 13th January 2020 in which they extended the deadline of
replacement of un-modified engines with modified engines to 31st May 2020. Later on, 27th
May 2020, DGCA issued yet another order wherein the deadline was further extended to 31st
August 2020 keeping in view of the COVID19 pandemic.
By 26th August 2020 all the PW1127G-JM engines (280 engines) of Indigo had
complied with SB 72-00-0111 i.e., all its NEO fleet (140 aircraft) were installed with LPT
modified engines.

2 ANALYSIS
2.1 General
Both pilots were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate the flight.
The aircraft had a valid Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of incident. The Aircraft
held a valid Certificate of Release to Service which was issued at the airport of
departure. Airworthiness Directives & Service Bulletins were complied with. Transit
Inspections were carried out as per the approved Transit Inspection Schedules and all
higher Insp
guidelines and specified in Maintenance Programme.
2.2 Circumstances Leading to the Incident
VT-IPT was equipped with PW1127G-JM engine Sr. No. 770516. This engine was
fitted with pre-modified LPT 3rd stage blades which had less crack growth resistance and
impact tolerance. The aircraft suffered LPT 3rd stage blade failure while climbing passing
and
checklist/procedures for Engine Vibration and EGT overlimit and decided to divert to Delhi,
as the engine parameters were abnormal.
Crew informed ATC about diversion but no Emergency was declared by the crew. After
obtaining necessary clearances from ATC, Delhi, the aircraft landed safely at Delhi. During
post flight inspection while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine, LPT 3rd stage
blades were found damaged.
Incident was one amongst series of similar events and hence Pratt and Whitney did
not carry out Technical Investigation into this case.
2.3 LPT 3rd stage blade failure and preventive action.
Based on the analysis by NAL, Bengaluru to study Material of Construction (MoC) it
was determined that the pre-modified LPT stage 3 blades are made of gamma-based
Titanium Aluminide (TiAl) which is, in general, brittle in nature having low fracture toughness.
16

Seite 23:
Although, the alloy used for LPT blades 3rd stage blades is an improved version of TiAl alloys
with engineered microstructure, the material still lacked adequate damage tolerance
properties. It was confirmed during the fractography study conducted by NAL, Bengaluru that
LPT 3rd stage blades of the Engine ESN 770187, 770530 and 770516 had fractured
instantaneously in a brittle manner and none of the blades showed presence of any
signatures of progressive failure such as fatigue. The fatigue test further confirmed that the
material does not have enough crack growth resistance and after initiation, the crack
propagated instantaneously leading to fracture. It is, therefore, evident that the LPT stage 3
blades failed in flight as these blades could not withstand possible impact from material
liberated upstream and got fractured instantaneously. This led to engine high vibration and
EGT overlimit.
Subsequent to directions issued by the DGCA to equip all aircraft with LPT modified
engines, the airlines complied with SB 72-00-0111 and all its A320 NEO fleet (140 aircraft)
were installed with LPT modified engines.
3 CONCLUSION
3.1 Findings
1. The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness, Certificate of Registration and the Certificate
of Flight Release before operating the incident flight.
2. Both pilots were appropriately qualified to operate the flight.
3. There was no fire and no injury to any occupant on board the aircraft.
4. During post flight inspection, while carrying out visual inspection of the involved engine,
i.e., inlet area and exhaust area of Engine # 1, Low Pressure Turbine 3rd stage blades
were found damaged.
5. The incident was similar to series of other events where LPT 3rd stage blades failed
during operation. The failure was considered to be a known issue by the OEM and no
Technical Investigation was carried out by the OEM.
6. Failure Analysis of blades at NAL, Bengaluru indicated that the LPT 3rd stage blades
material had less crack growth resistance and damage tolerance which causes the
crack to propagate instantaneously after initiation leading to fracture.
7. Pratt & Whitney has issued SB 72-00-0111 to Introduce of a new LPT 3rd stage blade
made of a different material which is more resistant to impact damage. The airline has
incorporated the said SB in all its affected aircraft.
