FINAL INVESTIGATION REPORT ON SERIOUS INCIDENT TO GO AIR
AIRBUS A320 AIRCRAFT VT-WGJ AT BANGALORE ON 01/09/2018
1.0 FACTUAL INFORMATION
1.1 History of Flight
On 1st September 2018, Airbus A320 aircraft VT-WGJ was involved in a serious
incident while operating flight G8-283 from Bangalore to Pune. The aircraft was
under command of an ATPL holder (PF) with a CPL holder acting as Pilot
Monitoring (PM). There were 169 passengers on board. The incident occurred in
day light conditions. There was no fire or any injury to crew or passengers.
During takeoff roll, engine no. 1, N2 vibrations went very high at a ground speed
of 20 knots. The vibrations levels increased to 10.0 units and at 1500 radio
altitude, alert on ECAM (Master Caution) came up for high engine vibrations on
engine #1 and hence the QRH procedure was carried out after which the N2
vibrations parameters were at normal levels momentarily. The vibrations levels
increased again followed by other warnings i.e. Eng 1 OIL CLOG, Eng 1 OIL
FILTER DEGRADE, Eng 1 STALL. In addition, AUTO FLT/ AUTO THR was put
OFF and a decision was taken by the commander to continue on manual thrust.
The warnings were followed by Eng 1 FAIL.
The ECAM procedure to shut down Eng 1 was carried out. The PF decided to
return to VOBL (nearest airport) on priority and a PAN PAN call was made. No
assistance at the airport was requested. A single engine straight in ILS approach
was carried out. Following instructions of the PF, the PM had switched off the
Glideslope mode.
During final approach, several callouts were made by the PM with regards to
speed and alignment of the aircraft. PF accordingly carried out small adjustments
of eng 2 thrust. During approach, in an attempt to flare, attitude was raised. The
aircraft pitched up accordingly, but limited by the aircraft protection (αprot) which
had been activated, and touched the ground. As per PM, he was aware that it
1

Seite 7:
had resulted in hard landing but he had not conveyed it to PF. The aircraft taxied
to bay.
On ground, it was found that the ‘g’ value at touchdown has reached 2.68,
whereas the Manufacturer limitation is 2.6. DFDR output was provided to the
manufacturer and computation of landing ‘gʼ, based on parameters, (i.e. Landing
g, landing weight of the aircraft 64.45T and Rate of Descent at Touch down 13.1
feet/sec) gave a value of 3.25, classifying the event as a ‘Severe Hard Landing’. .
The occurrence was hence categorised as "severe hard landing".
The aircraft remained on ground for almost 6 months for maintenance activity.

1.3 Damage to Aircraft
The DFDR data of the flight was sent to Airbus for analysis. The Airbus
engineering team analyzed the DFDR data and it was confirmed that the landing
was “Severe hard landing” as the g value has gone up to 3.25. Following the
DFDR data analysis, the Airbus engineering team recommended for “Structural
Inspection for severe hard landing” on the following parts of Aircraft.
• Landing gear
• Vertical Tail plane.
• Wing
• Centre Fuselage & Centre wing box.
• Fuselage Cargo Door (FWD & AFT) surrounding structure.
• Forward & Aft Cargo Door.
• Bulk Cargo Door
• Emergency Exit Hatches.
After inspections, both main landing gears were removed, as recommended by
the supplier, Safran.

1.6 Aircraft Information
Airbus A320 Neo MSN 7737, Indian Registration VT-WGJ, was delivered in
November 2017 and is equipped with P & W Neo Engines. At the time of
occurrence, this Aircraft had logged 3096 hrs and 1969 cycles since new.
1.6.1 Operational Aspects
Following are the relevant extracts from FCOM/ QRH :-
With A/THR engaged, when a thrust lever is set below the CL detent, the
thrust of the associated engine is limited to the thrust lever position. Normal
operation of the A/THR system requires the thrust levers to be:
➢ In the CL detent for the two-engine configuration.
✓ If they are not set in the CL detent, “LVR CLB” flashes white on the FMA. If
one lever is in the CL detent and other one is not, then LVR ASYM is
displayed in amber
➢ TL of operating engine in MCT detent when in the one-engine-out
configuration (one TL at idle is considered one engine operation)..
✓ If the appropriate lever is not set in the MCT detent, “LVR MCT” flashes
white on the FMA
4

Seite 10:
High engine vibration requires the flight crew to monitor engine parameters,
especially the EGT, and cross check with the other engine. Thrust can be
reduced if conditions permit to do so, in order to maintain vibrations below the
amber threshold of 5 UNITS.
The ENG SD page is automatically displayed between 1st engine take-off
thrust and till 1500 ft RA. (The relevant SD page is automatically displayed as
soon as a fault or malfunction triggers a caution or warning message.) When
the cockpit unit (Units) value of vibrations exceeds 5 Units, the Units values on
the Engine SD page change from GREEN to AMBER. The high vibration
ECAM caution is inhibited below 1500ft RA.
The maximum level of vibration that can be recorded on the DFDR is
10UNITS.
5

Seite 11:
As per stall procedure, whenever engine stall (In flight) is detected by Flight
Crew before FADEC or instructed by ECAM, the thrust lever of the affected
engine should be set to idle.
When one engine TL is at idle, it is considered as single engine operation
and the other engine thrust lever at that time should be set to MCT. The
ECAM caution ‘THR LEVERS….MOVE’ would be displayed and in addition,
the FMA will display ‘LEVER MCT’ flashing in white. A master caution is
repeated every 5 seconds if one lever is at idle and the other is not at the
MCT detent.
When the AP is in OP DES mode, it manages the aircraft trajectory to target
the selected CAS, but the aircraft trajectory can only be level flight or
descent.
6

Seite 12:
ENG1 FAIL ECAM caution is triggered when the engine core speed falls
below idle, whereas ‘ENG SHUTDOWN’ is triggered when the engine
Master Switch is set to OFF by the flight crew. As per the FCTM, in the
event of an engine failure, thrust levers should be set to MCT.
The stabilization criterion is given below. This requires that the flight crew must
initiate a Go Around, if approach is not stabilized.

2. ANALYSIS
2.1 GENERAL
Both operating flight crew were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate
the flight. Their preflight Medical was valid. They had undergone all refresher
trainings and nothing was wanting as per the requirements.
The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness/ Airworthiness Review
Certificate at the time of incident. The aircraft held valid Certificate of Release to
Service. The mandatory Modifications and SBs were complied with.
The weather at the airport at the time of incident was fine and is not a
contributory factor to the incident.
2.2. ENGINEERING (LOAD) ANALYSIS
The reason for engine parameters going beyond limits during flight and
resultant “In Flight Shut Down” was because of No. 3 Bearing Failure. This is a
known problem with Neo Engines. The initial review of the DFDR data plots
indicated a max vertical acceleration of 2.68 g. ‘g’ values is sampled 8 times a
second. Vertical ‘g’ is sampled 8 times per second in the DFDR readout and the
peak value may not have been captured if it occurred between 2 recorded
values. .
DFDR raw data was shared with Airbus who, carried out loads computation, in
order to assess the severity of the event. The feedback was received wherein it
was indicated that though the touchdown ‘gʼ was 2.68, but computation of
landing ‘gʼ, based on parameters, (i.e. Landing g, landing weight of the aircraft
64.45T and Rate of Descent at Touch down 13.1 feet/sec) gave a value of 3.25,
classifying the event as a ‘Severe Hard Landing’.
Airbus has introduced new FDIMU software incorporating a new load 15 report
which analyses additional parameters to the ones used in the existing software.
With the application of the new software, the load 15 report will directly classify
similar events as a ‘Severe Hard Landing’.
16

Seite 22:
As far as severe hard landing is concerned, the aircraft or maintenance aspects
have not contributed to the incident.
2.3 DFDR Analysis
The aircraft returned to Bangalore due to high vibrations followed by In-flight
Engine Shut Down (IFSD) in Flight. The aircraft is fitted with P & W Neo engines
and the engine vibration is a known issue. A DFDR analysis report was
received from Airbus and has been used while analyzing the operational
aspects of this occurrence.
2.3.1 High Engine Vibrations & ATB
During take-off roll, at a ground speed of 20 knots, Eng # 1 N2 Vibrations
reached 10.0 Units. The other engine was operating normal with all parameters
stable. Auto pilot was engaged in SRS/ NAV mode, when the aircraft was at
200 ft radio altitude with CAS as 164 knots. The N2 vibrations of 10.0 Units
continued. The engine SD page got displayed and N2 vibrations flashed
number of times during the above period.
Though ENG 1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution was recorded (as per ACARS), the
caution is inhibited until 1500 ft RA. At that time, EGT on engine # 1 was 940°C
and on engine # 2 it was 890° C. The caution was displayed above 1500ft RA
The aircraft continued to climb and while crossing 5000 ft with AP1 and A/THR
engaged, vibrations were still 10.0 Units. Eng # 1 thrust lever was moved back
but the Eng # 1 N2 vibrations continued to be 10.0 Units.
The crew continued the flight with CAS of 225 knots. After crossing 5500 feet,
altitude was selected to 14000 feet. Both thrust levers remained in CL detent
with auto thrust active. Engine # 1 N2 Vibrations continued at 10.0 UNITS.
While crossing 8500 feet with AP1 and auto thrust still engaged, Eng # 1 thrust
lever was reduced to 9 degrees. Eng #1 N2 vibrations dropped from 10.0 Units
to 5.0 Units. When the aircraft was climbing through 10000 feet, Eng # 1 thrust
lever was moved from 9 degrees to 11 degrees. Correspondingly N2 vibrations
17

Seite 23:
also started increasing and went beyond 5.0 Units. Auto Pilot 1 and Auto thrust
were still engaged.
Eng # 1 N2 vibrations further increased to 6.8 Units which triggered the master
caution warning twice. The Eng # 1 N2 vibrations reached 10.0 Units with
engine stall. This caused the master caution second time.
The aircraft still continued to climb with Eng # 1 thrust lever moved to idle and
Eng # 2 thrust lever in CL detent. This triggered the master caution every 5
seconds to alert the crew that autothrust is limited and to move the thrust levers.
Auto thrust was disengaged when the aircraft was crossing 12900 feet which
stopped the master caution. Auto pilot 1 remained engaged.
The crew decided to return and auto pilot was changed to OP DES mode when
the aircraft was at 14000 feet. The selected altitude was reduced to 12000 feet
and selected CAS was increased to 250 knots from 214 knots. There was no
change in thrust lever positions, engine #1 TL remained at idle and engine #2
TL remained in CL detent, delivering climb power.
After about 84 seconds of initiation of turn back, Engine #1 oil filter degraded
and filter clog messages were recorded on the ACARS report. (The ENG page
was displayed on the SD.)
As engine #2 was at climb power and engine #1 was at idle, the aircraft energy
was too high. The Autopilot was unable to maintain the 250 kts selected speed,
even in level flight since Auto thrust was OFF and speed increased beyond 260
kts.
By reducing the thrust on engine #2, the AP was able to meet the selected CAS
(target) and increase the aircraft descent rate towards the selected altitude.
After 30 seconds of reducing thrust on Eng # 2, engine fail ECAM caution got
triggered with Eng # 1 EGT increasing from 610 degree C to 1095 degree C.
The flight crew shut down Eng #1 by taking Engine #1 lever to OFF. The thrust
levers were not moved as required in the FCOM. Engine #1 TL remained at idle
18

Seite 24:
and engine #2 TL remained at 16° (intermediate position between idle and CL)
for a minute.
When the aircraft was at 6700 ft and descending to selected altitude of 5500 ft,
speed was at selected CAS of 220 kts. A/THR remained OFF. Both TLs were at
idle. With both APs engaged, LOC capture mode got engaged. LOC TRK mode
got engaged a minute later, indicating that LOC is captured and was tracked.
During this period, Glideslope mode was engaged and captured.
2.3.2 Approach & Landing
(The aircraft had touched down at 00:51:08 hrs. UTC.)
During approach, at 00:49:31 hrs. UTC, aircraft was in CONF FULL (Slats/
Flaps 27°/40°), Landing gear was selected down, Ground spoilers were armed,
Auto brake was not armed and AP1 & 2 were engaged. At 1120 ft RA, the
aircraft was tracking the GS and LOC. A/THR was disengaged with both TLs at
idle. CAS was 135 kts. reducing. Aircraft pitch was 3.5º increasing.
At 00:49:37, when the aircraft was at 1000 ft RA (decreasing), AP 1 & 2 was
disconnected by the flight crew. CAS was 125 kts. Both FDs were engaged in
GS/ LOC modes and the aircraft was aligned to the glide slope and localiser.
19

Seite 25:
PF carried out manual approach. Between 1000 ft to 400 ft RA, high activity
was recorded on Pilot Flying side stick. Pitch varied between 3º and 12º nose
up and Roll varied between 0º and 10º (right wing down). Vertical descent rate
varied between 0 ft/ min and 1600 ft/ min. CAS varied between 125 kts and 113
kts (VLS was 127 kts).
During this period, low energy aural warning “SPEED SPEED SPEED” triggered
4 times. Thrust was manually increased on engine #2. Aircraft started to dip
under the glide slope by 1.4 dots and EGPWS aural warning “GLIDESLOPE”
was triggered at 620 ft RA for 14 seconds. Glideslope deviation reached 2.7
dots below glide slope at 400 ft RA. Alpha protection was activated 6 times.
AoA reached 12º (Alpha Prot) and 15º (Alpha Max).
The approach was continued despite the aircraft being unstable in attitude,
below the glideslope by 2.7 dots and its speed below VLS. In accordance with
the FCOM stabilisation criteria a go-around should have been performed.
20

Seite 26:
When the aircraft was at 400 ft RA, engine # 2 thrust was controlled manually
between idle and CL detents. At 250 ft RA, engine # 2 TL was progressively
reduced (reached to IDLE detent at 200 ft RA) then moved to the CL detent
before being set at IDLE detent again at 40 ft RA. Pitch increased from 5º to 10º
nose up. CAS reduced from 130 kts to 110 kts at landing (VLS –17kts). Roll
varied between 6º right wing down and 2º left wing down. Flare was performed
while full back stick order was applied. Alpha Prot was active. AoA increased
from +12.8° to +15.7° (= AoA max). Alpha Prot limited the AoA from increasing
further
At the time of touch down, CAS was 109 kts (VLS -18kts), vertical descent rate
was -752 ft/ min, recorded VRTG was 2.68 g, pitch was 10º nose up and AoA
was at Alpha Max (15º)

2.4 Circumstances leading to the incident
On application of take-off thrust, Eng # 1 N2 Vibrations increased to 10 Units. It
is the maximum value that can be displayed on the engine SD page. Though
ECAM is inhibited during take-off and till 1500 ft RA after take-off, N2 VIB would
have been flashing during that period on the lower ECAM/ SD page.
During climb at about 4500 feet (1500 ft RA), ENG1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution
displayed. Flight crew carried out QRH checklist as per the procedure. The flight
was continued, though thrust on engine #1 was reduced sufficiently for the
vibrations to reduce below the threshold of 5 Units. The crew kept climbing to
FL 140 whereas they could have leveled off for trouble shooting.
As soon as Eng #1 thrust was increased, once again there was increase in the
Eng N2 vibrations and stalling of Eng # 1. Engine #1 thrust lever was set to idle
while engine #2 thrust lever was left at CL detent. In the event of one engine
thrust lever at idle, other engine thrust lever should be set to MCT. The inaction
of the crew induced an FMA display “LVR MCT” (flashing) caution, which
repeated every 5 seconds. The flight crew at this stage should have moved the
thrust levers to MCT, but instead they disconnected the auto thrust which
remained so till end of the flight.
The flight crew after discussion among themselves decided to return to
Bangalore. PAN PAN Call was given. The reason mentioned was due technical.
Here, correct reason i.e. engine problem could have been mentioned.
During descent, engine #1 failed and was shutdown. Engine #2 was reduced to
idle till reaching 1000 ft RA. Till that point, the flight was on auto pilot, with auto
thrust OFF (engine #2 was controlled manually).
Aural low energy SPEED SPEED SPEED warnings were triggered from 1000 ft
and GLIDESLOPE warnings were triggered from 620 ft RA. The aircraft was
below the Glideslope by 1.4 dots. Successive side stick pitch up inputs resulted
in the pitch increasing up to 12º, activating the Angle of Attack protection. The

approach was continued despite being unstable and significantly below the
Glideslope (2.7 dots below the Glideslope). The unstable approach continued till
touchdown. All checklists were carried out but PM did not advise PF to go
around.
The aircraft made a severe hard landing at the runway threshold while the PF
was still commanding a full back stick. The aircraft pitch was 10° nose up, Alpha
Prot was active and speed was 18 kts below VLS.
3 CONCLUSIONS
3.1 Findings
3.1.1 Both operating flight crew were appropriately licensed and qualified to operate
the flight. Their preflight Medical was valid.
3.1.2 The aircraft had valid Certificate of Airworthiness/Airworthiness Review
Certificate and Certificate of Release to Service at the time of incident.
3.1.3 The weather at the airport at the time of incident was fine and is not a
contributory factor to the incident.
3.1.4 Shortly after take-off thrust was applied, engine # 1 vibrations increased to 10
UNITS, the maximum value that can be displayed on the engine SD page. The
take-off roll and flight was continued. ENG1 HIGH VIB ECAM caution displayed
at 1500 ft RA and approximately, one minute later, thrust on engine # 1 was
reduced to keep the vibrations below the threshold of 5 Units.
3.1.5 Engine #1 thrust lever was set to idle while engine #2 thrust lever was left at CL
detent. This induced an FMA display “LVR MCT” (flashing), repeated every 5
seconds. After about 88 seconds, the flight crew disconnected auto thrust,
without making any changes to the thrust lever positions.
3.1.6 An in-flight turn back was initiated to the departure airport.
3.1.7 During descent as engine #1 failed, it was shutdown. Thrust of engine # 2 was
reduced to idle.
3.1.8 A manual approach was performed by the PF. (No AP/ ATHR below 1000’ RA)

3.1.9 “SPEED SPEED SPEED” and “GLIDESLOPE” warnings were triggered.
Successive side stick pitch up inputs resulted in the pitch increasing up to 12º,
activating the Angle of Attack protection.
3.1.10 The approach was unstable. The aircraft went below the glidepath. The speed
was too low. The aircraft was in a low energy state.
3.1.11 PF has not carried out Go Around, nor the PM advised PF to go around.
3.1.12 The aircraft envelope protections limited the Angle of Attack from exceeding
Alpha Max during the final approach and landing.
3.1.13 The aircraft performed a severe hard landing (2.68 g) while the PF was still
commanding a full back stick. Airbus subsequently computed the g value as
3.25 and incident was assessed as severe hard landing
3.1.14 At the time of touchdown, the aircraft pitch was 10° nose up, Alpha Prot was still
active and the speed was 18 kts below VLS.
3.1.15 During rectification on ground, oil chip was detected in MCD No. 3 (AGB &
MGB).
3.1.16 The involved engine was replaced and on the recommendation of the supplier,
Safran, both main landing gears were also replaced.
3.2 CAUSE
Unstabilised approach due to improper understanding of automation and thrust
management after failure of one of the engines in flight resulted in severe hard
landing and consequential damages.
4.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
For all Airlines flight crew
4.1 During simulator trainings (normal flying or with failures), emphasis should be
laid on the use of appropriate levels of automation at all times. There should be
clear understanding of automation, its appropriate level of selection and
confirmation by assessing the aircraft response.

4.2 To maintain handling skills, adequate manual flying should be practiced on
aircraft, whenever conditions are favorable. Prior appropriate briefing MUST be
given to Pilot Monitoring for giving callouts of parameter deviations promptly so
that smooth transition back to automation can be carried out if required.
4.3 There should be strict compliance of stabilized approach by the flight crew. PM
should play an assertive role while calling out deviations and carry out a “Go
Around”, if required.
